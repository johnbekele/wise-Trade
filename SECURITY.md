# Security Guidelines for Wise Trade

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `env_template.txt` as a template only
- Generate strong, unique secret keys for production
- Rotate credentials regularly

### Secret Management
- All sensitive data should be stored in environment variables
- Use strong, randomly generated keys (32+ characters)
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Use different credentials for development, staging, and production

### Database Security
- Use MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist for additional security
- Enable authentication on all database connections
- Use connection strings with proper authentication
- Regularly rotate database passwords

### API Security
- Never expose sensitive information in API responses
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS in production

## 🚨 Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Exposed MongoDB URI in Test Endpoint
**Issue**: The `/api/test/config` endpoint was exposing the MongoDB URI
**Fix**: Removed the sensitive data from the response

### 2. Secret Keys in Logs
**Issue**: Secret keys and tokens were being logged in console output
**Fix**: Removed all debug print statements that exposed sensitive data

### 3. Template File Security
**Issue**: `env_template.txt` contained values that looked like real credentials
**Fix**: Updated template to use clear placeholder values

## 🛡️ Current Security Measures

- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ `.env` files excluded from version control
- ✅ No sensitive data in API responses
- ✅ No debug logging of sensitive information
- ✅ Secure JWT token handling
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt

## 🔄 Credential Rotation

If credentials are compromised:
1. **Immediately rotate** the MongoDB Atlas password
2. **Update** all environment variables
3. **Revoke** any compromised tokens
4. **Update** all applications using the old credentials

## 📝 Security Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Strong, unique secret keys generated
- [ ] Database credentials are secure
- [ ] API endpoints don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] No debug logging of sensitive information
- [ ] HTTPS enabled in production
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation in place

## 🆘 Emergency Response

If a security breach is detected:
1. **Immediately** rotate all credentials
2. **Review** access logs
3. **Update** all affected systems
4. **Notify** relevant stakeholders
5. **Document** the incident and response

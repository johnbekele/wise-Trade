Cathie Wood Loads Up On This Tesla Rival As Elon Musk's EV Giant Gears Up For Q3 Earnings - BYD (OTC:BYDDY),"On Tuesday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made a significant move by purchasing shares of BYD Co Ltd (OTC:BYDDY). This decision comes shortly after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer announced a recall of over 115,000 vehicles due to battery-related safety issues.

The BYD Trade

The Trade was executed through Ark's ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ). The fund acquired 55,523 shares of BYD Co Ltd, valued at approximately $737,900 based on the latest closing price of $13.29. This purchase increases Ark's exposure to the electric vehicle sector, despite recent challenges faced by BYD.

BYD recently faced a setback when it issued a recall for more than 115,000 vehicles, including the Tang and Yuan Pro series, due to potential battery safety risks. The recall was prompted by design defects that could lead to circuit board corrosion, posing safety hazards.

Despite these issues, Ark Invest's decision to buy more shares indicates a likely continued belief in BYD's long-term potential in the EV market.

It should be noted that on Monday, Ark had purchased 69,000 BYD shares worth $941,850 through ARKQ. Wood is considered bullish on BYD-rival Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). She has called Tesla CEO Elon Musk ""the most productive human being on Earth and in space in history."" Tesla is Ark Invest's largest holding, with its stake valued at nearly $1.5 billion. Across Wood's family of ETFs, Tesla accounts for a combined portfolio weight of about 9.94%. The Musk-led company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Wednesday after the market close.

Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show that BYD's principal rival, Tesla, has a Value in the 3rd percentile. Here is how other major EV players stack up.

Wall St futures dip after Dow gains on upbeat earnings; Netflix results disappoint By Investing.com,"Investing.com-- U.S. stock futures edged lower on Tuesday evening after Wall Street ended mixed, with strong quarterly results from major industrials lifting the Dow, while weakness in tech shares weighed on the Nasdaq.

S&P 500 Futures inched 0.1% lower to 6,768.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 25,232.75 points by 20:28 ET (00:28 GMT). Dow Jones Futures dipped 0.1% to 47,112.0 points.

Dow gains on upbeat corporate earnings; CPI data eyed

In Tuesday's regular session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.5% higher after hitting a record high during the day, boosted by upbeat earnings from companies such as General Motors, 3M, and GE Aerospace.

The S&P 500 closed largely flat, while the NASDAQ Composite slipped 0.2% as some technology and growth stocks lost momentum.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) shares surged nearly 15% after the automaker raised its full-year forecast, citing resilient demand.

GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) gained after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results and lifting its outlook, while 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) rose around 8% after improving its profit forecast.

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares advanced over 4% after the beverage maker reported solid third-quarter demand and revenue growth.

Investors are now turning their attention to Friday's U.S. Consumer Price Index data, which could cement expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at its October meeting.

The shutdown of large parts of the federal government is complicating data flows and could cloud the inflation signal. The gridlock, now entering its fourth week, has delayed or paused key economic data releases, adding uncertainty.

Netflix, Mattel slip on weak results; Tesla on tap

In after-hours trading, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares slipped more than 6% after the company posted disappointing quarterly results, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Mattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT) shares dropped 5% in post-market hours, after missing estimates and reporting weaker North American sales.

Attention will now shift to a fresh slate of corporate earnings later this week, with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) due to report on Wednesday, followed by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and other major companies in the coming days.",2025-10-22
"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Bull, Base and Bear Price Prediction and Forecast","Shares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 4.07% over the past five trading sessions after losing 4.84% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer has finally pushed the stock into the green on the year with a gain of 17.02%. Still, since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, 2024, the stock has fallen 7.54%. When the company last reported earnings in July, it announced that in Q2, revenues were down 12% year over year (YoY), EPS was down 23% YoY, operating income was down 42% YoY and vehicle deliveries fell to 384,122 -- down 14% YoY. Since launching in India in mid-July, Tesla has only received a paltry 600 orders.

Indeed, Tesla's stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk's role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk's friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla's outlook remains clouded.

In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let's check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it's a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.

Tesla's Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along

For a stock that's fallen significantly, I'd expect the growth narrative to have been severely impacted. Tesla's latest quarterly earnings results were not incredible. Yet, I do think that the sell-off is mostly a mere correction to make up for the euphoric melt-up experienced in the back half of last year. Indeed, investors got too far ahead of themselves when it came to Tesla's most ambitious growth drivers. Now that investors are taking a step back, we'll have to wait and see if Tesla can advance such drivers meaningfully.",2025-10-21
"Market Collapsed 23% 38 Years Ago, Would Be 11,000 Points Today","I watched it happen. On October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 508 points, which was 22.6%. It fell from 2,246.74 at the open to 1,738.74 at the close on the day known as Black Monday. Such a drop would be just shy of 11,000 points today. The market was actually worse than that when taken over two days. The Dow had dropped almost 5% the Friday before. The anxiety over the weekend between the two was terrific.

Just before the retreat, there was a concern about U.S. trade deficits. Congress had just begun to talk about whether M&A activity had tax rates that were too low. Interest rates had been rising. However, the primary cause was wider. Many traders believed that the market was too expensive. Famous economist Robert Shiller thought, according to the University of Chicago, the explanation for the drop was that ""the crash was as much a sociological or psychological phenomenon as an economic one.""

The overvaluation explanation was based on factors that are somewhat like the current market situation. The value of the Dow rose 67% from January 1985 to the middle of 1987. Over our most recent three years, it is up about 57%.

The primary question about whether the market will drop sharply today will not be measured by the Dow. That yardstick is too narrow now. The S&P 500 is a much better metric. And, within the S&P 500, the Magnificent 7 stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) are 34% of the entire value of the index.

There are already cracks in the valuations of the seven stocks. This is certainly true of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the price of which is only up 2% this year. This is largely because it does not have a high-end artificial intelligence product, while the valuation of AI-based companies is soaring. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has also been a laggard. It is up 9% this year, to some extent because of the political leanings of CEO Elon Musk. Additionally, there is a debate about whether Tesla is a car company or an AI and robotics operation.

At the absolute core of the value of the world's most valuable stocks is the future of AI. The earnings of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are based almost entirely on whether their bets on AI are correct. Each has already said it will spend tens of billions of dollars on AI data centers this year and next. At the core of the value premise today is whether AI is a product people will pay for or one that is given away almost entirely for free.

Early answers about the future of AI will be part of the earnings and forecasts for the third quarter of this year. If these are shaky, the market will rest downward, perhaps by a staggering amount.",2025-10-21

GM Soars Most in Five Years as Truck Demand Spurs Outlook Boost,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co.'s shares jumped the most since 2020 -- and reached the highest levels since it emerged from bankruptcy about a decade before that -- after the automaker raised its profit guidance on buoyant truck sales and a dose of tariff relief.

Six months after pulling its full-year forecast over uncertainty about the Trump administration's tariffs, GM said Tuesday it now expects to make $12 billion to $13 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2025 -- up from a previous range of $10 billion to $12.5 billion it had affirmed in July.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The improved outlook comes as GM is seeing a jump in sales of high-margin, gas-powered SUVs and trucks partly enabled by moves to ease federal emissions rules. Even so, the projection is below its initial guidance in January for as much as $15.7 billion, a sign of the toll taken by the imposition of tariffs and an erosion of its electric vehicle business.

In a letter to shareholders and on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra thanked President Donald Trump for extending through 2030 a tariff discount on some imports for carmakers that produce and sell completed automobiles in the US.

""We appreciate the administration's ongoing support for American innovation and jobs, and we look forward to progress on trade deals with countries like Canada and Mexico,"" she said on the call.

Shares of the Detroit-based manufacturer rose 15%, the best one-day gain since March 2020, to close regular trading at a record $66.62. The stock is up about 25% this year, ahead of a 15% gain so far in the broader S&P 500 index.

Chris McNally, an analyst at Evercore with an ""outperform"" on GM, highlighted the company's prediction next year's earnings may be even stronger than in 2025, signaling bullish momentum. ""Not sure what anyone could possibly even nitpick about this,"" he said in a research note.

The forecast shows how GM is managing disruption from the White House in areas ranging from emission penalties and electric vehicle subsidies to levies on imports of components and vehicles. Those changes have hurt profits and further undercut an already wavering initiative to electrify GM's fleet by 2035 in a bid to better compete with Tesla Inc. and fast-growing Chinese rivals. Earlier this month, GM said it booked a one-time charge of $1.6 billion to restructure its struggling EV business.",2025-10-21

Exhibit 1

Take back your vote from proxy advisors: vote in the interests of Tesla shareholders

Anyone who has actually reviewed the full ISS and Glass Lewis reports know their recommendations don't add up -- these proxy advisors are using their simplistic checklists and recommending votes that defy basic common sense and ignore Tesla's record and vision of exceptional value creation.

And we think we know why.

ISS and Glass Lewis weren't built to evaluate companies like Tesla.

Their model is based on standardized benchmarks -- conventional, one-size-fits-all thinking designed for the average company. But Tesla isn't conventional, and neither is the size of our financial returns.

Since our IPO, we have achieved a total shareholder return of over 39,000%, far outpacing the S&P 500 and countless other investment alternatives during that period.[1] Nevertheless, ISS and Glass Lewis have repeatedly recommended against our compensation proposals since 2018, ignoring the fact that these proposals have been completely incentive-based and have helped drive a 20x improvement in our market capitalization from March 2018 to August 2025.

This year, both firms once again recommend against our CEO performance award (Proposal 4), notwithstanding their own acknowledgement that:

So, why are ISS and Glass Lewis opposing the award?

Because their benchmark approach is designed to flag deviations from the norm, it is incapable of accounting for the sort of extraordinary growth Tesla has experienced. As a result, their analysis cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement. Any company seeking to provide equity incentives outside of the proxy advisors' benchmark gets flagged for ""dilution"" -- even if those incentives require massive returns before any shares are issued.[5]

Their analysis of Proposal 3 -- our proposal that would, among other things, allow the Board to address compensation for Elon that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned) -- makes this problem even clearer. ISS's rationale for its scoring? That Tesla ""exceeds the ISS benchmark,""[6] which ISS repeats like a machine stuck in a loop: does not compute.

ISS and Glass Lewis see deviation and mislabel it as failure because their current framework leaves them no other option. But our shareholders are not expecting Tesla to conform to the median. As you have demonstrated time and time again through your votes, you expect Tesla to remain exceptional.

ISS's and Glass Lewis's recommendations are disconnected from financial reality.

Evaluating Tesla requires breaking the mold and ignoring benchmarks based on ordinary companies. It demands a tailored analysis that reflects our unique value creation trajectory. ISS and Glass Lewis have never understood Tesla because they lack the tools, and therefore the capacity, to make company-specific financial analyses.

In recent litigation over Texas S.B. 2337, which requires proxy advisors to disclose the financial analyses underlying their recommendations, ISS told a federal court that doing so would demand ""tremendous personnel resources"" and it would take ISS ""years to develop"" compatible systems.[7] Glass Lewis said that it would need to hire ""several additional analysts"" and ""compliance officers"" and spend ""hundreds of thousands of dollars [annually]"" to produce compliant disclosures.[8]

In their own words, the firms advising shareholders on Tesla's future lack the infrastructure to apply financial analysis and logic to their advice.

Think about that when you are voting your Tesla shares, particularly on proposals that are designed to build long-term value at Tesla. Unlike ISS and Glass Lewis, you actually have a financial interest in Tesla. Can you afford to vote in line with firms that don't and can't back up their recommendations with financial logic?

ISS and Glass Lewis view governance as being disconnected from financial returns.

ISS and Glass Lewis create standardized governance checklists based on their annual surveys, inviting a few hundred investors, issuers, and advisors to check boxes on potential updates each year. The responses are tallied and averaged, resulting in standards that are then applied to thousands of companies. In other words, their methodology drives companies to be ""average"" -- the very antithesis of Tesla's ambitions.

Whereas their governance standards are based on algorithmic conformity, our Board has designed a governance model that is tailored to the unique circumstances facing our company. Whereas their governance standards are based on aggregated public feedback that is definitionally untethered from company-specific financial performance, our Board believes that good governance is not an end in and of itself but rather an ongoing commitment to engage in practices that allow us to generate durable, long-term shareholder returns.

We have assembled a board with the critical skills, experience, temperaments and perspectives to deliver on that commitment. The directors up for reelection at this year's Annual Meeting, Ira, Kathleen and Joe, are critical to our next chapter. Working with the full Board, they have overseen Tesla's transformation from an upstart electric vehicle manufacturer to a provider of autonomous solutions that are changing the world, all while delivering massive shareholder value creation along the way.

Our longest standing independent director, Ira, has been a key driver of the governance framework that created over 39,000% total shareholder returns during his tenure.[9] Ira, who founded and manages a leading impact investing venture capital firm, lives our philosophy that governance should serve -- and not be disconnected -- from financial return for shareholders.

Kathleen, another of our independent directors, has demonstrated her command of compensation, governance and employment law in evaluating and structuring our CEO compensation throughout two of the most transparent governance processes in modern day corporate America. As Tesla continues to grow shareholder value through technological progress, Kathleen's decades of legal and operating experience and the compensation and human capital and management knowledge will be crucial for Tesla to win the AI talent war.

Ira and Kathleen are widely regarded as governance leaders by their peers. The National Association of Corporate Directors -- frequently seen as the gold standard in real world corporate governance -- has named both directors in its ""Directorship 100"" for being among ""the most influential leaders in the boardroom and corporate governance community.""[10]

If ISS and Glass Lewis were capable of conducting a nuanced, company-specific assessment of our governance needs, we believe it would be readily apparent that these directors provide the independent oversight, knowledge, integrity and expertise that are necessary to advance long-term value for Tesla's shareholders. Unfortunately, they are not capable of such an assessment.

Instead, ISS's and Glass Lewis's rigid applications of their one-size-fits-all governance checklists has resulted in ill-informed -- and at times nonsensical -- advice for Tesla shareholders this year. For example:

Putting aside ISS's and Glass Lewis's manifest disregard for our clear disclosures, our shareholders' will and even plain English, their one-size-fits-all approach to governance is problematic for shareholders because it punishes directors for daring to deviate from proxy advisor policies. For good governance to flourish, directors need to be encouraged to think critically about the course of action that makes the most sense for their company and its shareholders, rather than mechanistically adhering to so-called ""standard practices.""

That is why we are urging you to think critically about ISS's and Glass Lewis's recommendations, rather than ""robovoting"" with them.

Are ISS and Glass Lewis aligned with your interests?

As you may have seen, both ISS and Glass Lewis have recently announced that they are working on significant updates to their product offerings that they say will allow them to actually serve client interests. ISS announced that it will begin offering ""tailored research reports"" based on ""client-specific criteria.""[14] Glass Lewis announced that it was working on a similar update because ""the traditional one-size-fits-all model of proxy advice no longer meets the needs of a diverse client base.""[15]

These announcements acknowledge that ISS and Glass Lewis are not currently providing advice tailored to the needs, criteria and interests of different investors. Yet, their recommendations for how investors should vote Tesla shares this year are based on their current policies. Therefore, it is crucial for you to consider whether these proxy advisor recommendations align with your values and serve your best interests. Even ISS's report appears to acknowledge that its recommendation on our CEO performance award, for example, may not be aligned with the philosophy of a shareholder who is focused on Tesla continuing to achieve extraordinary financial returns.[16]

When deciding whether it is in your best interests to follow proxy advisor recommendations, shareholders should also consider conflicts created by ISS's and Glass Lewis's opaque business model in which they offer consulting services to the same companies they rate. The shortcomings of these proxy advisors are echoed by state and federal officials, who are scrutinizing ISS's and Glass Lewis's practices, including by implementing laws that require that their recommendations be based on the financial interests of shareholders, implying a failure to do so in the past and presently.

Say yes to robots, say no to robotic voting.

ISS and Glass Lewis dominate the proxy-advisory market. Certain organizations frequently robovote based on the recommendations of ISS and Glass Lewis.

For our shareholders who are deciding whether to follow proxy advisor recommendations this year, exercising thoughtful judgment is critical to protecting your shareholder returns:

The real question is: are you going to forfeit your judgment and ""robovote"" with proxy advisors who have admitted they are unable to look out for your best interests, or are you going to take back your vote and support a company that has delivered remarkable financial value for shareholders time and time again?

We think the choice is obvious -- Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals.

"Tesla Bets $1 Trillion On The Cult of Musk  --  As Robots Stall Out - BYD (OTC:BYDDF), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is about to rubber-stamp one of the most extravagant CEO pay packages in corporate history -- a $1 trillion, 10-year deal for Elon Musk -- even as its valuation stretches further from reality.

Musk's compensation includes $31 billion in restricted stock and could soar past $113 billion in total. It also comes at a time when the car company's market share is shrinking.

That'd be bad enough if it weren't just a car company trying to be something else. Its Optimus robot projects, for example, are stalling. And those long-promised robotaxis? They remain years behind rivals like Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) and Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Zoox.

Indeed, the chorus of boos is loud ahead of the company's third-quarter earnings, which are to be announced on Wednesday. Still, Musk has plenty of like-minded business people cheering on his wild salary bump.

ISS Says 'No,' Wood Cries Socialism

International Shareholder Services (ISS) opposes Musk's pay package, citing ""unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.""

If approved, the plan would become the most extensive CEO compensation package ever granted by a public company. It could potentially increase Musk's stake in Tesla by 12% if the automaker reaches a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion in 10 years.

But here's the thing: Under Musk, Tesla experienced a decline in its global market share, which has dropped from about 23% to 18% over the past year. Its market capitalization remains strong at $1.4 trillion, though its stock price has faced significant volatility.

ARK Invests' CEO Cathie Wood isn't worried. She even criticized the ISS's recommendation to vote against the pay package.

""Isn't it sad, if not damning, that institutional shareholders rely on proxy firms to tell them how they should vote? Index funds do no fundamental research, yet dominate institutional voting,"" Wood said, calling index-based investing a ""form of socialism.""

Tesla Has Trouble Justifying Trillions

The automaker's $8 trillion market cap dream hinges on a narrative that Tesla is no longer just a car company but a futuristic AI powerhouse.

""After a brutal few quarters we are finally starting to see stable demand trends for Tesla,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives recently wrote. ""The Tesla story going forward is around the AI transformation being led by the autonomous and robotics initiatives.""

That narrative is fraying fast.

The Optimus robot project is on pause. Milan Kovac, the head of engineering for Optimus, resigned in June, and a separate Optimus AI lead, Ashish Kumar, left the company in September to join Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).

Tesla is now pinning its hopes on a merger with Musk's other PR-nightmare of a company, xAI.

Whether Tesla can wield M&A to capture market share from its competition is not yet clear. Most mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions tend to fail in the long term.

The deal won the endorsement of at least one other billionaire: Chamath Palihapitiya. The Social Capital founder even suggested including Musk's other venture, SpaceX, in a three-way.

""I'm here for it,"" Palihapitiya, a Musk admirer, said.

Musk's rivals, meanwhile, are accelerating: BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF) is selling EVs for a fifth of Tesla's price. And Waymo's autonomous vehicle (AV) fleet is already on the streets, slated to launch in London in 2026.

As NYU professor Scott Galloway quipped on a recent podcast, Musk is ""the David Copperfield of the modern economy"" -- and the magic may be fading.

If Tesla deserves a trillion-plus valuation for lagging in autonomy, then Google, which owns Waymo, should be worth an extra trillion itself, Galloway's co-host, Ed Elson, added.

Regulatory Challenges

Divisiveness within the Trump administration, which had an acrimonious breakup with Musk, could exacerbate Tesla's challenges. The elimination of EV tax credits keeps the cars expensive. Recall how the company hyped up the lower-priced Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard. Yes, it comes with fewer features than the traditional models, and the vehicles have cheaper price points than Tesla's main vehicles.

However, with the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, consumers are actually paying more for models with fewer features than they would have paid for the regular version before the tax credits were eliminated.

The robotaxi segment is also in trouble. Trump's NHTSA administrator nominee, Jonathan Morisson, has advocated for stricter oversight of self-driving vehicles, potentially clashing with Duffy's approach. Meanwhile, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) plans to introduce legislation that would effectively ban fully autonomous driving, calling such vehicles ""terrible for working people.""

On the other hand, Tesla's expansion aligns with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's announcement that the NHTSA will relax autonomous driving regulations, a move that bolsters Tesla's robotaxi ambitions as federal standards evolve.

""The rules of the road need to be updated to fit the realities of the 21st century,"" Duffy said.

Ironically, Musk doesn't seem to like Duffy, calling him a ""Dummy"" when it comes to NASA.

""The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2-digit IQ,"" Musk said.

Tesla Q3 Preview: Is The EV Story Ending? - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),"Third-quarter earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the market close Wednesday could serve as a bellwether for the electric vehicle sector and overall technology sector as the first Magnificent 7 stock to report in this earnings season.

Here are the earnings estimates from analysts, what experts are saying ahead of the report and the key items to watch.

Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Tesla to report third-quarter revenue of $26.16 billion, up from $25.18 billion in last year's third quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company has missed analyst estimates for revenue in four straight quarters and missed estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

Analysts expect Tesla to report third-quarter earnings per share of 53 cents, down from 72 cents per share in last year's third quarter.

The company has missed analyst estimates for earnings per share in three straight quarters and missed estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

What Experts Are Saying: Tesla beating third-quarter delivery estimates, which have already been announced, was due to a ""push-forward effect,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard said in a new investor note.

The analyst, who maintained an Overweight rating and $355 price target, said increased demand came from the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit. Sheppard said he expects a weaker fourth quarter for deliveries.

Tesla's introduction of lower-priced vehicles comes at an ""opportunistic time"" according tot the analyst. Sheppard said the new vehicles can attract budget-conscious buyers to Tesla.

The analyst said key catalysts for Tesla to watch for the earnings call include robotaxis, ramp-up of lower-cost models, FSD adoption, the launch of the cybercab and an update on the Optimus Bot.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is looking beyond electric vehicle demand in Tesla's earnings and commentary and focused on key areas like robotaxis, artificial intelligence and China. ""After a brutal few quarters we are finally starting to see stable demand trends for Tesla,"" Ives said.

The analyst maintained an Outperform rating on Tesla with a $600 price target.

""The Tesla story going forward is around the AI transformation being led by the autonomous and robotics initiatives.""

While some analysts are bullish on the new lower-cost Model Y and Model 3 variants, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said they may not be cheap enough or have enough features to catch initial demand.

The analyst has a Neutral rating and $425 price target on Tesla ahead of the earnings report.

""While we think the broader 3/Y lineup offers good value in general (based on features like acceleration and safety), the degree of differentiation on price and features/form factor for the Standard trims is more limited than we had initially expected for Tesla's lower cost models,"" Delaney said.

The analyst stated that at one point, Tesla had planned to introduce a new model that would cost 50% less than the Model 3 and Model Y; however, instead, consumers are getting variants. Delaney said the new, lower-cost models promised were a key item from Tesla's 2023 investor day.

Freedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods said the earnings report will play a key in the story of Tesla moving forward, one that could shift away from electric vehicles.

""The focus may shift away from auto sales and be more about robotics, autonomous driving and AI,"" Woods said in a weekly newsletter.

Woods said this is the first quarterly report from Tesla since the near $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk was revealed. The plan sees Musk take no salary and receive compensation based on hitting milestones.

""Investors will get their first look as to how he and the company are progressing on those goals when they report Wednesday afternoon.""

Key Items to Watch: Tesla previously reported third-quarter deliveries of 497,099, a new company record. The company also reported third-quarter production of 447,450 vehicles.

With third-quarter figures reported, attention likely turns to commentary on fourth quarter demand and expectations, with the expiration of the federal EV tax credit a major headwind.

Declining demand for the Cybertruck could also prompt questions about Tesla's plans for the vehicle's future.

The company stated that the Tesla Semi and Cybertruck were both planned for volume production in 2026, as mentioned in the second-quarter results. Analysts and investors will be scrutinizing vehicle timelines to determine if this remains the case.

Tesla's second quarter featured commentary on AI and robotics, but this one could go even further as the company looks to these areas for future growth.

TSLA Price Action: Tesla stock trades at $445.22 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $212.11 to $488.54. Tesla stock is up 17.4% year-to-date in 2025.

Tesla's Full Self-Driving Flaws Trigger Refunds and Regulatory Probes,"In the high-stakes world of electric vehicles, Tesla Inc. finds itself navigating treacherous waters as its ambitious push into autonomous driving technology encounters mounting backlash. Recent reports highlight how the company's ""Full Self-Driving Supervised"" feature, once touted as a revolutionary leap, is now exposing critical flaws that could cost billions in refunds, legal fees, and lost consumer trust. Customers who paid premium prices for vehicles expecting advanced autonomy are increasingly vocal about unfulfilled promises, with some demanding compensation for features that remain undelivered or underperform.

This discontent stems from Tesla's aggressive rollout of FSD across its lineup, including older models, which has amplified visibility of the system's limitations. According to a detailed analysis by Electrek, the expansion is ""backfiring"" as real-world usage reveals inconsistencies in navigation, obstacle detection, and overall reliability, leaving drivers to intervene frequently despite the ""supervised"" moniker.

The Mounting Customer Backlash

Industry observers note that Tesla's strategy of overpromising on autonomy dates back years, with CEO Elon Musk repeatedly forecasting full self-driving capabilities ""this year"" since at least 2019. Yet, as adoption grows, so do complaints: forums and social media are rife with accounts of FSD failing in everyday scenarios, from erratic lane changes to ignoring traffic signals. This has led to a surge in refund requests, with some owners seeking reimbursements for the $8,000 to $12,000 they spent on the software package.

Regulatory scrutiny is intensifying too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened multiple investigations into Tesla's Autopilot and FSD systems following accidents, adding to the potential financial strain. Electrek estimates that if even a fraction of the millions of FSD-equipped vehicles result in claims, Tesla could face liabilities exceeding several billion dollars, a figure that echoes past recalls but on a far larger scale.

Financial Ripples and Market Pressures

Tesla's balance sheet, while robust with over $30 billion in cash reserves as reported in recent quarters, isn't immune to these pressures. The company's stock has fluctuated amid broader EV market challenges, including softening demand and competition from rivals like Rivian and Ford. A separate Electrek piece from earlier this year flagged accounting irregularities, including $1.4 billion in unexplained discrepancies, raising questions about financial transparency at a time when autonomy bets are under the microscope.

Moreover, Tesla's pivot toward robotics and energy storage -- evident in its $10 billion capital expenditure plans for 2025, as outlined in company filings -- could be jeopardized if FSD fallout diverts resources. Analysts warn that class-action lawsuits, already brewing, might force Tesla to reallocate funds from innovation to settlements, potentially stalling progress on next-generation vehicles like the anticipated Cybercab.

Strategic Crossroads for Autonomy

For industry insiders, this ""iceberg"" represents a pivotal test of Tesla's business model, which relies heavily on software upsells to boost margins. While the company dominates fast-charging infrastructure, with Electrek noting its lead in Q3 growth amid over 64,000 U.S. DC ports, rivals are catching up, eroding Tesla's moat. The irony is stark: a feature meant to differentiate Tesla may now undermine it, as customers question the value of paying for unfinished tech.

Looking ahead, Tesla must address these shortcomings through software updates or revised marketing to rebuild confidence. Failure to do so risks not just financial hits but a broader erosion of its pioneering image in the EV sector. As one venture capitalist remarked anonymously, ""Tesla built its empire on bold visions, but reality is catching up -- and the bill could be enormous."" With earnings calls looming, stakeholders will watch closely for signs of course correction in this unfolding saga.",2025-10-21
Tesla iOS App Update Introduces Maintenance Tracking for Owners,"In the rapidly evolving world of electric vehicles, Tesla Inc. continues to push boundaries by integrating software innovations directly into the ownership experience. The company's latest update to its iOS app introduces a dedicated Maintenance section, providing owners with unprecedented visibility into their vehicle's upkeep needs. This feature, which debuted recently, lists specific items like tire rotations, cabin air filter replacements, and wiper blade changes, complete with estimated timelines and costs if serviced at official Tesla centers.

By tapping into this section -- found under Service > Request Service > Maintenance in the app -- users can view the remaining life of components and even schedule repairs. It's a move that underscores Tesla's commitment to a seamless, data-driven ownership model, reducing the guesswork that often plagues traditional car maintenance. According to details reported by Mashable, the update is currently iOS-exclusive, with Android support still pending, highlighting Tesla's phased approach to platform parity.

Unlocking Proactive Vehicle Care Through App Integration

Industry analysts see this as more than a convenience; it's a strategic enhancement to Tesla's ecosystem, where over-the-air updates and app connectivity already define the brand. For insiders, this Maintenance tab represents a subtle shift toward predictive analytics, leveraging vehicle telemetry to anticipate needs before they become issues. Imagine receiving a notification that your brake fluid is due for a flush in three months, priced at around $150, based on real-time driving data -- it's the kind of foresight that could minimize downtime and extend vehicle longevity.

Comparisons to competitors like Rivian or Lucid Motors reveal Tesla's edge: while others offer basic service reminders, Tesla's version includes esoteric items such as ""Windshield Camera Area Precision Cleaning"" for $80, ensuring autonomous features remain optimal. As noted in a Reddit thread on r/TeslaLounge, owners have long used the app for diagnostics, but this formalized section elevates it to a comprehensive tool, potentially cutting service center visits by empowering DIY-savvy users.

Implications for Tesla's Service Model and Market Position

This innovation arrives amid broader industry pressures, including supply chain constraints and rising repair costs for EVs. Tesla's app update could alleviate some of these by promoting transparency -- owners know exactly what to expect, fostering trust in a brand often criticized for opaque service pricing. Data from Not a Tesla App suggests the feature ties into digital service records, allowing technicians to access a vehicle's full history instantly, which streamlines repairs and reduces errors.

For automotive executives, the real intrigue lies in how this fits Tesla's vertical integration strategy. By controlling the app, hardware, and service network, Elon Musk's company minimizes third-party dependencies, a tactic that has helped it dominate EV sales. Yet, challenges remain: the iOS-only rollout may frustrate Android users, and without global pricing variations, international owners might find estimates less accurate.

Future Horizons: From Maintenance to Full Ecosystem Control

Looking ahead, experts speculate this could evolve into AI-driven recommendations, perhaps integrating with Tesla's Full Self-Driving suite for holistic vehicle health monitoring. Publications like TeslaNorth highlight how the app now includes tire centers and screen sharing, pointing to a unified platform for all ownership aspects. This not only boosts customer retention but also positions Tesla as a tech company first, vehicle maker second.

Critics, however, warn of privacy concerns -- constant data collection on component wear could raise questions about user consent. Still, for industry insiders, this Maintenance section exemplifies Tesla's software-first ethos, potentially setting a benchmark that forces rivals to accelerate their digital transformations. As EVs become mainstream, such tools may redefine what it means to ""own"" a car, turning passive drivers into informed stewards of advanced machinery.",2025-10-21
GM Scales Back EV Goals as Rivals Dump Prices for Emissions Rules,"In the competitive arena of electric vehicles, General Motors Co. is navigating a shifting market where regulatory pressures have forced some automakers to slash prices dramatically. According to GM's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson, rivals have been offloading their EVs ""for whatever they could get"" to comply with stringent clean-air rules, a tactic that has distorted pricing and profitability across the industry. This revelation came during a recent earnings call, highlighting how emissions standards, particularly in regions like California and parts of Europe, are compelling manufacturers to prioritize volume over margins to avoid hefty fines.

Jacobson pointed out that these regulations, aimed at reducing carbon footprints, have inadvertently created a fire-sale environment for EVs. Automakers facing non-compliance penalties are incentivized to flood the market with discounted models, undercutting competitors who are trying to build sustainable EV businesses. For GM, this has meant adjusting its own strategy, scaling back ambitious all-electric targets and refocusing on hybrids and traditional vehicles to maintain profitability amid the chaos.

The Regulatory Squeeze on EV Pricing Strategies

As governments worldwide tighten emissions mandates, the auto industry finds itself in a high-stakes balancing act. Clean-air regulations, such as those from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Union's CO2 targets, require automakers to achieve fleet-wide emissions averages, often pushing them to sell more zero-emission vehicles even at a loss. This has led to what industry analysts describe as a ""compliance dump,"" where companies prioritize meeting quotas over long-term market health, resulting in EVs being priced far below production costs to clear inventory and avoid penalties.

GM's observations align with broader trends, where players like Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV have reported similar pressures. In a report from Business Insider, Jacobson's comments underscore how this dynamic has eroded profit margins, with some rivals resorting to deep discounts that make it challenging for established brands to compete without sacrificing their own financial stability. The result is a market where consumer deals abound, but underlying economics remain precarious.

GM's Strategic Pivot Amid Market Turbulence

In response, GM has taken decisive steps to insulate itself from these distortions. The company, which once pledged to go all-electric by 2035, has now dialed back those plans, as detailed in coverage from Business Insider. Instead, GM is emphasizing plug-in hybrids and internal-combustion models, a move that incurred a $1.6 billion charge but positions it for steadier growth. Jacobson emphasized that while rivals chase regulatory compliance through aggressive pricing, GM is focusing on profitable scaling, with EV sales hitting records in the third quarter despite the headwinds.

This pivot reflects lessons from global competitors, particularly China's EV giants like BYD Co., who innovate at breakneck speeds. As noted in another Business Insider piece, GM President Mark Reuss has urged Western automakers to match that agility, compressing development timelines to stay competitive. Yet, with U.S. EV market share climbing to 10.5% through September 2025, per data from Yahoo Finance, the industry faces uncertainty under potential policy shifts, such as those influenced by recent political changes.

Implications for the Broader Auto Sector

The ripple effects of these pricing wars extend beyond GM, signaling potential consolidation in the EV space. Startups and legacy players alike are grappling with evaporating federal incentives, as highlighted in analyses from Car and Driver, where third-quarter sales surges were attributed to last-minute tax-credit rushes. Tesla Inc., with its established scale, appears poised to weather the storm, but others may falter without regulatory relief or innovative cost-cutting.

Looking ahead, industry insiders anticipate that as regulations evolve, automakers will need to invest heavily in battery technology and supply chains to achieve genuine profitability. GM's approach -- balancing compliance with fiscal prudence -- could serve as a blueprint, but only if rivals abandon the ""whatever they can get"" mentality that has defined recent years. With global EV sales topping 2.1 million in a single month last year, per reports from CleanTechnica, the sector's future hinges on sustainable strategies rather than desperate discounts.",2025-10-21
Proxy Firms Advise Against Elon Musk's $1T Tesla Pay Package Vote,"Proxy Advisors Amplify Concerns Over Musk's Compensation

In a move that underscores growing scrutiny over executive pay at Tesla Inc., proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders reject Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation package. This follows a similar stance from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), marking a significant challenge for the electric-vehicle giant ahead of its shareholder vote scheduled for November 6. The package, which could become the largest in corporate history, has drawn criticism for its sheer scale and potential dilution of shareholder value.

Glass Lewis cited ""significant concern"" regarding the package's size and structure, arguing it could undermine investor interests without sufficient ties to long-term performance metrics. According to a report from Business Insider, the firm highlighted risks such as excessive dilution and questioned whether the deal aligns with Tesla's strategic goals amid competitive pressures in the EV market.

Historical Context and Prior Rejections

This isn't the first time proxy firms have opposed Musk's pay. Both Glass Lewis and ISS advised against his 2018 compensation plan, which was initially valued at $56 billion but has ballooned due to Tesla's stock surge. Despite those recommendations, shareholders approved it overwhelmingly back then. Now, with the package's value inflated to $1 trillion, the stakes are higher, reflecting Tesla's market capitalization growth and Musk's pivotal role in driving innovation.

Analysts point out that the current proposal seeks to reinstate and potentially expand upon the voided 2018 award, following a Delaware court ruling that struck it down earlier this year. Reuters reported in a recent article that Glass Lewis's opposition emphasizes the ""excessive"" nature of the deal, urging investors to consider governance implications, including board independence and executive accountability.

Market Reactions and Investor Sentiment

Tesla's stock rose 1.8% on the day of the announcement, as noted by Traders Union, suggesting that some investors remain optimistic about the company's fundamentals despite the controversy. Upcoming catalysts, such as earnings reports and the compensation vote, could sway sentiment further. However, major advisory firms' unified front may influence institutional holders, who control a substantial portion of Tesla's shares.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect divided opinions among retail investors, with some expressing frustration over repeated challenges to Musk's pay, viewing it as essential for retaining his leadership. Electrek.co, in its coverage, described the package as ""ridiculous"" and highlighted how both ISS and Glass Lewis are pushing for a 'no' vote, potentially signaling broader concerns about corporate excess in the tech sector.

Implications for Tesla's Governance

The rejection push comes at a critical juncture for Tesla, as it navigates slowing EV demand, regulatory hurdles, and ambitious projects like autonomous driving and robotics. Critics argue that approving such a massive package could set a precedent for unchecked executive rewards, eroding trust in board oversight. Investing.com echoed this in its analysis, noting that shareholders are urged to prioritize sustainable growth over outsized incentives.

For industry insiders, this saga raises questions about balancing visionary leadership with fiduciary responsibility. Musk's track record -- transforming Tesla into a $1 trillion-plus company -- clashes with governance norms that demand proportionality. As the vote approaches, the outcome could reshape executive compensation standards across Silicon Valley and beyond, testing whether innovation justifies astronomical rewards.

Potential Outcomes and Broader Industry Impact

If rejected, Musk has hinted at shifting focus to other ventures, potentially disrupting Tesla's trajectory. Supporters, including some prominent shareholders, argue the package is performance-based, tied to milestones already achieved. Yet, as detailed in a Sharecafe article, opposition from proxy advisors like Glass Lewis could galvanize dissenting votes, forcing Tesla's board to reconsider its approach.

Ultimately, this debate encapsulates the tension between entrepreneurial ambition and corporate accountability. With Tesla's future hinging on Musk's involvement, the November vote will not only decide his pay but also signal how investors value disruptive leadership in an era of heightened scrutiny. Observers from publications like the Financial Times have long tracked similar conflicts, underscoring that while Musk's charisma drives value, governance guardrails remain essential to protect all stakeholders.",2025-10-21

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

"How To Trade SPY, Top Tech Stocks Using Technical Analysis","Enter your email to get Benzinga's ultimate morning update: The PreMarket Activity Newsletter

Good Morning Traders!

Today features a light economic calendar once again. The focus will briefly shift north with Canada's September CPI report at 8:30 AM Eastern, though it is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on U.S. markets. Traders will also receive the Redbook Retail Sales update at 8:55 AM Eastern, offering a minor pulse check on consumer trends.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller will be in focus as he delivers remarks twice today, first at 9 AM Eastern and again at 3:30 PM Eastern. Market participants will listen for any comments regarding inflation or the Fed's rate path, especially with the U.S. CPI release looming on Friday.

With limited data and ongoing macro uncertainty, liquidity is expected to remain thin and volatility reactive. Traders should remain patient, avoid overtrading during slow periods, and stay alert for sharp price moves sparked by unexpected headlines or positioning shifts.

Now, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPY opens at 671.50, where buyers are attempting to keep the index pinned near recent highs. A firm push above this level could lift price into 672.75 and 674.00, with further strength extending into 675.25. If momentum builds, SPY may press toward 676.55 and 677.80. Each step higher would confirm that buyers are maintaining control in a market still driven by liquidity and sentiment rather than data.

If SPY loses 671.50, sellers may aim to test 670.15. A breakdown here could lead to 668.85 and 667.55, with heavier pressure targeting 666.20. If weakness deepens, the tape may slide toward 664.90 before stabilizing. These levels will reveal whether buyers continue to defend support or step back to reassess ahead of Friday's CPI release.

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)

QQQ starts the morning at 611.50, with bulls looking to sustain upward momentum in tech. A move higher could carry price into 612.65 and 613.80, with continued strength driving into 614.95. If demand holds, QQQ may extend toward 616.10 and 617.25. Each push upward reinforces market confidence in large-cap leadership as traders wait for new catalysts.

If QQQ drops below 611.50, sellers may pull price into 610.25. A break here opens the door to 609.00 and 607.75, with continued weakness driving toward 606.45. If pressure persists, QQQ may test 605.20 before finding support. These zones will determine whether traders are buying dips or beginning to reduce exposure before key economic data later this week.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Apple opens at 261.75, and bulls will look to hold this zone to keep short-term sentiment positive. A rise above could send price into 262.70 and 263.65, with stronger momentum extending toward 264.55. If enthusiasm continues, Apple could climb into 265.50 and 266.45. Each incremental push higher would show sustained interest in megacap names despite the quiet macro backdrop.

If Apple slips below 261.75, sellers may look to test 260.80. A drop through here could lead to 259.85 and 258.90, with additional downside targeting 257.95. If weakness persists, the stock may reach 257.00 before stabilizing. These levels will be watched closely to see whether Apple's strong recent trend can continue without broader market support.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)

Microsoft begins the day at 517.00, where buyers will look to defend this level as a base for continuation. A push above could lift price into 518.25 and 519.55, with follow-through momentum driving into 520.80. If strength continues, MSFT could reach 522.10 and 523.40. Each leg higher reinforces the ongoing pattern of strength in large-cap tech even as market catalysts remain limited.

If MSFT loses 517.00, sellers may test 515.70. A break below here opens the path to 514.40 and 513.10, with heavier pressure possibly driving into 511.75. If weakness expands, MSFT could slip to 510.45 before rebounding. These levels help outline whether traders are positioning defensively or continuing to lean into long exposure.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

NVIDIA opens at 182.75, with bulls aiming to keep momentum alive following several indecisive sessions. A move higher could lift price into 183.85 and 184.95, with further upside driving into 186.05. If strength builds, NVDA may reach 187.10 and 188.20. Each level higher shows renewed appetite for semiconductor exposure despite limited data to fuel risk-taking.

If NVIDIA breaks below 182.75, sellers may test 181.65. A drop here could bring 180.55 and 179.45 into play, with deeper selling carrying into 178.35. If pressure intensifies, price could slide toward 177.25 before finding traction. These areas will be key for gauging whether dip buyers remain active in the face of quiet trading conditions.

Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)

Alphabet starts the morning at 256.00, and buyers will look to sustain strength near this area. A rise above could lift price into 257.00 and 258.00, with momentum potentially carrying into 259.00. If buyers remain in control, GOOGL could extend toward 260.05 and 261.10. Each advance would signal continued accumulation in communication services names as investors stay patient for fresh macro data.

If GOOGL fails to hold 256.00, sellers may look to press price into 255.00. A break there could trigger a move into 254.00 and 253.00, with further weakness dragging into 252.05. If selling accelerates, GOOGL may touch 251.05 before stabilizing. These zones mark the key inflection points for short-term sentiment.

Meta Platforms Inc (META)

Meta opens at 736.00, where bulls are looking to extend recent gains. A push above here could drive price into 738.20 and 740.40, with continued momentum lifting into 742.55. If strength persists, META could reach 744.75 and 746.90. Each incremental rise suggests traders remain confident in the growth sector despite the slow macro week.

If META drops below 736.00, sellers may test 733.85. A break here opens the path to 731.70 and 729.55, with heavier pressure driving into 727.45. If weakness persists, price could slide toward 725.30 before finding footing. These levels will show whether buyers remain committed or begin trimming exposure ahead of CPI later this week.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

Tesla begins the day at 446.25, with buyers looking to maintain composure following a streak of range-bound sessions. A lift above could send price into 447.80 and 449.35, with further upside carrying into 450.90. If momentum holds, Tesla could advance into 452.45 and 454.00. Each move higher reinforces confidence that buyers are beginning to rebuild short-term control.

If Tesla slips below 446.25, sellers may push toward 444.70. A breakdown here opens the door to 443.15 and 441.60, with heavier pressure driving into 440.10. If selling continues, Tesla may reach 438.60 before stabilizing. These areas help outline where short-term support could attract responsive buying.

Final Word: Good luck and trade safely!

GM Raises Outlook as Strong Truck Demand Dulls Tariff Pain,"Chris McNally, an analyst at Evercore, highlighted GM's prediction next year's earnings may be even stronger than in 2025, signaling bullish momentum. ""Not sure what anyone could possibly even nitpick about this,"" he said in a research note.

The forecast shows how GM is managing disruption from the White House in areas ranging from emission penalties and electric vehicle subsidies to levies on imports of components and vehicles. Those changes have hurt profits and further undercut an already wavering initiative to electrify GM's fleet by 2035 in a bid to better compete with Tesla Inc. and fast-growing Chinese rivals. Earlier this month, GM said it booked a one-time charge of $1.6 billion to restructure its struggling EV business.",2025-10-21

GM raises outlook as strong truck demand dulls pain from tariffs,"Shares of the Detroit-based manufacturer rose 6.7 per cent in premarket trading to US$61.90 as of 6:35 a.m. in New York.

In a letter to shareholders, CEO Mary Barra thanked President Donald Trump for extending through 2030 a tariff discount on some imports for carmakers that produce and sell completed automobiles in the U.S. ""GM is very well positioned as we invest to increase our already significant domestic sourcing and manufacturing footprint,"" she said.

Let me understand this, because of the sociopath in the White House, GM and other American auto manufacturers will now be increasing their production of large ICE, and de-emphasizing electric and clean energy vehicles.

In other words by all appearances the U.S. is ceding clean energy production to Europe and Asia, and it will be the U.S. that will be left behind the rest of the world.

Does anyone recall what happened in the 70's? The US auto industry faced significant losses to foreign automakers because of the consumer shift to more fuel-efficient vehicles.

I won't be surprised if history repeats itself, and it will be much more brutal this time, because in all areas this administration is moving the country backwards by at least 70 years, and the damage done by this administration will be very difficult for us to catch up as the rest of the world moves ahead and leaves us behind.",2025-10-21

Tesla (TSLA) Stock: Why Wednesday's Earnings Should Beat Wall Street's Low Estimates - Blockonomi,"Investors will focus on updates about new lower-priced Model 3 and Y versions, robotaxi expansion plans, and the Optimus humanoid robot

Tesla stock was down 0.8% in early Tuesday trading at $443.73 ahead of the company's third-quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The electric vehicle maker is expected to beat Wall Street's estimates, though whether investors will care remains an open question.

Tesla, Inc., TSLA

Wall Street is projecting earnings per share of 55 cents on revenue of $27.2 billion for the quarter. The numbers look conservative given Tesla's actual performance.

Tesla delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter. That's about 54,000 more cars than analysts had projected.

Those extra vehicles represent roughly $2.4 billion in sales. Yet Wall Street's estimate for total automotive sales sits at just $20.6 billion, having risen only $600 million since the delivery report came out.

The lag suggests analysts haven't fully updated their models yet. Third-quarter automotive estimates are only about $600 million higher than the $20 billion Tesla generated in Q3 2024, when it sold 34,209 fewer vehicles.

Tesla also deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in the quarter. That's up from 6.9 gigawatt-hours in the same period last year.

The numbers matter, but CEO Elon Musk's commentary might matter more. Investors will be listening for updates on EV demand and the robotaxi business.

Tesla launched lower-priced ""Standard"" versions of its Model 3 and Y vehicles in October. Order numbers for these new models would give investors insight into demand at more accessible price points.

The robotaxi business launched in Austin, Texas in June. When Tesla plans to expand to another city or remove the safety monitor from the front passenger seat are key questions.

Musk warned in July about coming ""rough quarters"" ahead. The federal $7,500 EV purchase tax credit has expired, making electric vehicles more expensive for buyers.

Tesla stock is up about 11% year-to-date and 103% over the past 12 months as of Tuesday morning. The gains came despite Tesla selling fewer cars in 2025 than in 2024.

Investors have shifted focus to artificial intelligence opportunities instead. Tesla uses AI to train its autonomous driving systems and to develop humanoid robots.

The company hopes to start selling substantial quantities of its Optimus robot in 2026. ""Musk is well-known for his aggressive timelines for new products,"" said Zacks Investment Research stock strategist Andrew Rocco. ""If Musk can convince investors that future product road maps are still on track, investors will reward him.""

Options markets are pricing in a stock move of about 6% in either direction following the earnings release. Tesla shares have moved an average of 10% over the past four quarterly reports.

A 7% swing from last week's close would put shares either at about $470 or around $409. The higher price would mark Tesla's second-highest closing price ever.

Tesla shares jumped 22% after reporting third-quarter 2024 results. The company posted earnings per share of 72 cents against Wall Street's expectation of 59 cents.

Management's outlook energized investors too. Tesla said it expected to grow car sales in 2024, implying fourth-quarter deliveries of about 515,000 vehicles when analysts were projecting 500,000.

The company ultimately delivered about 496,000 cars in that quarter. That miss meant Tesla failed to grow total car sales in 2024 compared with 2023.

Analysts remain divided on Tesla's prospects. Of the 13 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, three recommend selling the stock and four rate it a hold.

Six analysts call it a buy. Their average price target is about $363, roughly 17% below Friday's close.

Tesla stock has been volatile this year. Shares started 2025 near an all-time high but were dragged down in the first quarter by tariffs on cars, aluminum, and steel, along with public backlash against Musk's political activities.

The stock rebounded after Musk had a public dispute with President Trump and pledged to focus more on his businesses. Tesla reports earnings Wednesday after the closing bell.",2025-10-21
Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory Ramps Up Production for Q4 After Chinese Sales Rebound,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the best big tech stocks to invest in now. On October 13, the company's Vice President, Tao Lin, announced on Weibo that Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory had begun ramping up production for Q4. The increase in output at the facility follows an improvement in China-made vehicle sales for the automaker.

Deliveries of locally built cars in September rose by 2.8% from the previous year, which ended a two-month sales decline in the Chinese market. This modest rebound in sales is partly attributed to the commencement of deliveries for Tesla's new six-seater vehicle in China, which has helped to boost showroom traffic and overall domestic demand.

The Shanghai plant is crucial for the company, supplying both buyers in China and export markets across regions like Asia and Europe. The production ramp-up is a strategic move as Tesla seeks to stabilize its global output and enhance its margins, following a period of uneven sales performance in several key markets.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation & storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

Texas Business Court's Broad Reach a Big Deal for Energy Sector,"Texas has officially entered the race to become the nation's second hub of corporate law, but at its core, the Texas Business Court expands access to justice.

The business courts were designed to streamline resolution of disputes that are both high-value and central to Texas' economy.

Texas is already home to many of the country's largest energy and technology companies; it only lacked a dedicated forum for complex business litigation. Traditional courts in Houston, Dallas, and other major cities were already handling heavy dockets of high-stakes commercial cases, often competing with criminal and family law matters.

With its new business courts, the state is positioning itself as a rival to Delaware, offering specialized judges and jurisdiction over high-value corporate and commercial disputes. Competition with Delaware wasn't the main purpose, though Texas has benefited.

Some high-profile companies have already moved from Delaware to Texas in search of predictability, signaling a broader ""DExit"" trend. Both Tesla Inc. and SpaceX moved from Delaware to Texas, MercadoLibre proposed moving its US legal domicile from Delaware to Texas (subject to shareholder vote), and Meta Platforms Inc. earlier this year reportedly was exploring or in talks about reincorporating outside Delaware (including Texas) as part of its strategic review. These moves reflect growing unease with Delaware's standards and highlight why Texas' reforms are drawing attention.

The new courts aren't corporate courts in the Delaware sense. Texas' business courts have jurisdiction extending beyond internal governance and derivative actions to include large commercial disputes -- such as contract and ""qualified transaction"" cases exceeding $10 million, which often encompass high-value oil and gas matters. That broader reach makes them especially significant for companies embedded in Texas' energy economy, where litigation often blends governance questions with complex commercial and regulatory issues.

A critical difference lies in the role of juries. Delaware's Court of Chancery hears cases in equity, with judges deciding disputes without juries. Texas' business courts, on the other hand, permit jury trials, even in high-value commercial and governance disputes.

That choice reflects Texas' legal culture but also adds complexity. Although specialized judges bring expertise, litigants must still account for the unpredictability of jury decision-making in complex business cases.

Notably, the Texas Legislature has already responded to concerns that the availability of jury trials could discourage incorporation in the state. During the 2025 session, lawmakers amended the Texas Business Organizations Code to permit corporations to include a waiver of jury trials in their charters or governing documents.

Framed alongside other pro-management adjustments, the reform allows organizers to decide whether to retain the traditional jury right or opt for the predictability of bench trials -- further signaling Texas' effort to attract and protect corporate managers and founders.

While most business disputes still arise from contracts, employment, intellectual property, and regulatory matters, shareholder and internal-affairs claims make up a comparatively small slice of corporate litigation.

Studies of derivative and fiduciary-duty suits show that they are relatively rare outside of mergers and acquisitions contexts -- and even when filed, they often settle before trial.

That reality helps explain Texas' choice to design a broad business court to ease the load on district courts -- covering high-value commercial disputes and permitting jury trials -- rather than replicating Delaware's narrow chancery model.

Although the docket is still light, early filings point toward energy-sector disputes. Roughly a quarter of the Texas Business Court's first-year cases involved oil and gas companies such as BP Energy, Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing, and Marathon Oil. Houston and Dallas divisions are handling most filings, and practitioners are watching to see how judges balance Texas' jury-trial option with Delaware's tradition of bench-only corporate cases.

Supporters say juries could make the process more accessible and transparent, while critics warn that verdicts offer little guidance for future deals. Practitioners are watching closely to see how Texas judges balance speed and predictability against the lack of precedent. For companies based in Texas, the courts promise the chance to litigate closer to home before judges steeped in business issues.

Recent legislative developments underscore Texas' orientation. Alongside creating business courts, Texas has passed measures that narrow shareholder rights, particularly in areas of inspection and derivative litigation. The moves align with a broader trend toward shielding boards from expansive oversight suits, mirroring some of Delaware's retrenchment but with an even more business-friendly tilt.

For companies considering incorporation or litigation strategy, the signal is clear: Texas is positioning itself as a jurisdiction that favors management stability and founder control over shareholder activism.

That message was reinforced at the end of last month, when the Securities and Exchange Commission formally approved the Texas Stock Exchange to operate as a national securities exchange. Headquartered in Dallas and set to launch trading in early 2026, the TXSE markets itself as a business-friendly alternative to New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, promising lighter compliance burdens and fewer environmental, social, and governance pressures.

Paired with legislative reforms and the new business courts, the exchange positions Texas not just as a rival forum for litigation but also as the nucleus of a broader corporate ecosystem built around pro-management priorities.

What do these developments mean in practice? The answer depends on where you sit. For boards and general counsel, Texas courts present an attractive venue -- specialized judges, faster dockets, and legislation that signals a friendlier stance toward management and founders.

But that tilt also raises concerns; leaning too heavily toward management may invite skepticism from investors and increase the risk of forum-shopping battles.

For investors, the picture is more complicated. Dual-tracking litigation in Delaware and Texas may become a necessary hedge, but the pro-management posture of Texas courts and recent legislation limiting shareholder rights suggest that outcomes may skew against them. Investors will need to weigh whether pursuing oversight claims in Texas offers meaningful recourse or simply entrenches management.

Founders and management teams will welcome this. Texas is actively building a legal ecosystem that protects entrepreneurial control and shields against what it frames as abusive shareholder litigation.

But even for them, the absence of a developed body of precedent introduces uncertainty -- management may gain stronger protections in theory but face less predictability in practice. Forum choice may therefore become a more explicit part of risk management for growth-stage companies and startups, not just for large public corporations.

The recommendation for legislators isn't simple. Advising clients in this environment means more than mastering the new statutes and procedures.

It requires guiding companies, investors, and founders through a policy tradeoff: between speed and precedent, local expertise and national norms, pro-founder protections and investor accountability. The practical challenge is helping clients build strategies that hedge against uncertainty while making the most of Texas' new forum.

Tesla Q3 2025 Preview: Pull-Forward or Real Rebound?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reports third-quarter 2025 results after market close on October 22. Analysts expect revenue to rise in the mid-single digits to $26.3 billion, while EPS is projected to fall 24% YoY to $0.55. The shares have been very volatile, currently up about 14% YTD but still more than 100% higher over the past year.

In Q3, Tesla delivered approximately 497,099 vehicles, up around 7% YoY, likely helped by price cuts and a rush of U.S. buyers taking advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before its September 30 expiration. Investors now want clarity on whether demand is genuinely rebounding or if Q3's spike was simply a pull-forward from early Q4. Analysts warn that with the credit gone, U.S. EV momentum may slow. Attention will also turn to how Tesla's new, more affordable models are being received in the U.S., along with metrics on the robotaxi rollout and updates on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software progress.

Margins remain under pressure due to product mix shifts, sustained high capex (gigafactories, energy-storage, and autonomy) and regional demand softness, particularly in Europe and China. For many, Tesla is no longer viewed as a car company, but credible guidance for Q4 and 2026 around its new models, robotaxi timeline, and FSD deployment will be crucial to justify its valuation premium.",2025-10-21

A Reuters investigation revealed that the company has faced complaints about rigged dashboard readouts providing overly optimistic range projections, leading to customer dissatisfaction. This highlights the delicate balance between hype and reality in the EV sector, where accurate range estimation is crucial for trust.

Moreover, external pressures, such as widespread battery errors in South Korea affecting nearly 4,500 Tesla vehicles, as covered by Electrek, pose risks to subsidies and market perception. Despite these hurdles, the push for doubled ranges continues, with rivals like BYD and CATL dominating global battery markets and introducing fast-charging tech that promises 373 miles from a 10-minute charge, per TechRadar.

Future Outlook for EV Innovation

Looking ahead, Tesla's hidden tech could redefine competitive dynamics, especially as startups and established players vie for supremacy. Reports from Business Insider on customized batteries achieving 752-mile trips in winter conditions suggest that real-world validation is building momentum. For industry insiders, this signals a shift toward more sustainable, long-haul electric mobility.

Ultimately, while challenges like production scaling and regulatory scrutiny remain, the integration of these advanced batteries could accelerate the transition to EVs. As Tesla refines its offerings, including cost-cutting measures on base models detailed in Automotive News, the focus on range extension will likely drive the next wave of innovation, benefiting consumers and the environment alike.",2025-10-20
"Tesla Launches Budget Standard Model Y at $42,990 with 260-Mile Range","Tesla's Latest Push in Electric Vehicle Innovation

Tesla Inc. has once again captured the attention of the automotive industry with significant updates to one of its flagship models, the Model Y, aiming to broaden its appeal amid intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. According to a recent report from Tesla Oracle, the company has introduced a stripped-down ""Standard"" variant of the Model Y, priced at an accessible $42,990, which undercuts previous entry-level options and targets budget-conscious consumers. This move comes as Tesla seeks to maintain its dominance in the SUV segment, where the Model Y has consistently ranked as a top seller globally.

The Standard Model Y features a single-motor rear-wheel-drive setup, delivering an estimated range of 260 miles on a full charge, down from the 320 miles offered by the Long Range version. Industry analysts note that this trade-off in range is accompanied by the omission of certain premium features, such as the panoramic glass roof and advanced audio system, to achieve the lower price point. These changes reflect Tesla's strategy to democratize electric mobility while preserving core performance attributes like rapid acceleration and over-the-air software updates.

Strategic Pricing and Market Positioning

Beyond hardware adjustments, Tesla's software ecosystem continues to evolve, providing ongoing value to owners. As detailed in release notes from Not a Tesla App, the latest update, version 2025.38, introduces enhancements like 3D building visualizations in navigation and improved dashcam viewer functionality. These features underscore Tesla's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology, which insiders say helps differentiate its vehicles from rivals like Ford's Mustang Mach-E or Hyundai's Ioniq 5.

For industry observers, this update cycle signals Tesla's response to regulatory pressures and consumer demands for safer, more intuitive driving experiences. The inclusion of side camera recording and new scroll wheel functions in the same software release, as reported by the same source, enhances user interaction without requiring physical modifications to the vehicle. Such iterative improvements have become a hallmark of Tesla's business model, allowing the company to refine products post-purchase and foster customer loyalty.

Implications for Manufacturing and Supply Chain

On the manufacturing front, Tesla's decision to streamline the Model Y lineup could optimize production efficiencies at its Fremont and Austin facilities. Sources from Top Electric SUV suggest that future Tesla models, including potential launches by 2028, will build on this modular approach, incorporating shared components to reduce costs. This is particularly relevant as raw material prices for batteries fluctuate, and Tesla navigates global supply chain disruptions.

Moreover, the updates align with broader industry trends toward affordability, especially as federal incentives like the $7,500 EV tax credit face uncertainty. Insiders point out that by offering a sub-$43,000 Model Y, Tesla positions itself to qualify for these credits, potentially boosting adoption rates in key markets like the U.S. and Europe.

Competitive Pressures and Future Outlook

Competition is heating up, with legacy automakers ramping up their EV offerings. A piece in Edmunds highlights how Tesla's 2025 lineup, including the Model Y, incorporates subtle design tweaks and efficiency gains to stay ahead. However, challenges remain, such as addressing range anxiety for the Standard variant, which may deter long-distance travelers.

Looking ahead, Tesla's focus on software-driven enhancements could pave the way for more ambitious features, like advanced Full Self-Driving capabilities outlined in Not a Tesla App's upcoming features list. For executives and investors, these developments reinforce Tesla's role as an innovator, though they must weigh the risks of feature dilution against market expansion goals. As the company prepares for its next earnings report, per insights from Yahoo Finance, the success of these Model Y updates will be a critical indicator of Tesla's resilience in a dynamic sector.

Sustaining Momentum Through Innovation

Ultimately, Tesla's strategy with the Model Y exemplifies its agile approach to product development, blending cost reductions with technological advancements. Industry veterans argue that this could help Tesla capture a larger share of the mass market, even as economic headwinds persist.

In conversations with suppliers and analysts, it's clear that Tesla's emphasis on over-the-air updates minimizes the need for costly recalls, setting a benchmark for the industry. As one executive noted, these key updates not only refresh the Model Y but also signal Tesla's long-term vision for scalable, software-centric vehicles that evolve with user needs.",2025-10-20

BAX CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT: Baxter International Inc. Shipping Pauses Trigger Securities Fraud Class Action after Stock Plummets 22% -- Investors Urged to Contact BFA Law,"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) and certain of the Company's senior executives for securities fraud after significant stock drop resulting from the potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Baxter, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/baxter-international-inc-class-action.

Investors have until December 15, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Baxter common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and is captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. Baxter International Inc., et al., No. 1:25-cv-12672.

Why Was Baxter Sued Under the Federal Securities Laws?

Baxter manufactures medical devices. One of the Company's most important growth drivers is its Novum IQ Large Volume pump (""Novum LVP""), a medical device that intravenously delivers medications, blood products, and nutrients to patients. In 2020, Baxter launched the Novum LVP in Canada while its application for FDA approval in the U.S. was pending. After the Canada launch, serious malfunctions such as under-and over-medicating patients plagued the pumps.

During the relevant period, Baxter told investors that the Novum LVP had ""the most advanced safety features that are available,"" stated the pump would provide ""a safer delivery of medication to the patient,"" and insisted that the ""rollout in Canada"" provided ""a lot of opportunity to just work out any last kind of bugs and kinks.""

As alleged, in truth, the Novum LVP suffered from systemic defects that caused a variety of malfunctions such as under-infusion, over-infusion, and non-delivery of fluids which put patient safety at risk and caused significant injuries and multiple fatalities.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On July 31, 2025, Baxter announced that it had decided to ""voluntarily and temporarily pause shipments and planned installations of the Novum LVP"" and was ""unable to currently commit to an exact timing for resuming shipment and installation."" On this news, the price of Baxter stock fell $6.29 per share, or more than 22%, from $28.05 per share on July 30, 2025, to $21.76 per share on July 31, 2025.

Tesla Model Y Camera Systems Face Safety and Privacy Vulnerabilities,"In the high-stakes world of autonomous driving, Tesla Inc.'s reliance on camera-based systems has positioned the company as a pioneer, but it also exposes vulnerabilities that can grind features to a halt. Owners of the popular Model Y crossover have increasingly reported scenarios where obscured or malfunctioning cameras lead to cascading failures in safety and convenience systems, raising questions about the robustness of vision-only autonomy. According to a detailed review in USA Today, when cameras on a Model Y Long Range become impaired -- whether by dirt, glare, or technical glitches -- the vehicle's advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can falter dramatically, disabling features like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist.

These incidents aren't isolated. Forums and user reports highlight how even temporary camera blackouts can transform a seamless driving experience into a frustrating ordeal. For instance, a thread on Tesla Motors Club details a new 2023 Model Y owner whose entire camera array failed post-software update, rendering sentry mode, backup views, and side cameras inoperable despite resets. Such failures underscore Tesla's bet on cameras over radar or lidar, a strategy that amplifies risks in adverse conditions like heavy rain or low light.

The Perils of Vision Dependency

Industry experts note that Tesla's ""Tesla Vision"" system, rolled out in updates since March 2023, aims to enhance camera clarity but hasn't eliminated blinding issues. A post on the same Tesla Motors Club forum describes persistent ""camera blinded"" warnings on a 2023 Model 3 Performance, occurring in everyday urban driving without streetlights. This mirrors broader concerns in a MotorTrend yearlong review, where testers found that losing camera functionality temporarily strips away the Model Y's most valuable assets, prompting doubts about their long-term reliability.

Beyond inconvenience, these camera lapses have safety implications. When reversing, a malfunctioning rear camera can leave drivers blind to obstacles, as outlined in troubleshooting guides from EVGOER, which recommends simple fixes like cleaning lenses or rebooting the system. Yet, for vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, obscured cameras can disable autonomous navigation entirely, forcing manual intervention and eroding trust in the technology.

Privacy and Ethical Quandaries

Compounding the technical challenges are privacy risks tied to Tesla's camera ecosystem. A Consumer Reports investigation reveals how in-car cameras, intended for monitoring driver attention or robotaxi operations, could inadvertently capture sensitive footage without clear safety benefits. This echoes a Reuters exposé on Tesla employees sharing invasive customer videos between 2019 and 2022, highlighting potential misuse.

User anecdotes further illustrate the fallout. A query on JustAnswer from a 2021 Model Y owner describes progressive camera failures starting with the rear and spreading to sides, disrupting daily use. Similarly, a Reddit discussion on r/TeslaModelY references camera trustworthiness tests, linking to engineer Mark Rober's video analysis that questions their accuracy in varied conditions.

Evolving Fixes and Future Implications

Tesla has addressed some issues through recalls and updates. For example, a 2023 recall of Model Y, S, and X vehicles targeted misaligned front cameras that could impair emergency braking, as reported by InsideEVs. Software patches, like one noted in TechRadar, have improved Hardware 3.0 camera visibility, offering clearer views for older models.

Looking ahead, as Tesla pushes boundaries with cheaper Model Y variants and enhanced FSD, insiders warn that camera reliability must improve to maintain consumer confidence. Owners like those in a The Driven survey cite camera glitches as top annoyances, alongside broader frustrations. For an industry racing toward full autonomy, these camera shortcomings serve as a cautionary tale: innovation must not outpace reliability, lest it leaves drivers -- and the promise of self-driving -- in the dark.",2025-10-20
"Texas Rolls Out $2,500 EV Grant to Replace Federal Tax Credit, Boosting Tesla","In a move that underscores the shifting dynamics of electric vehicle adoption in the United States, Texas has launched a new incentive program aimed at bolstering EV purchases following the termination of the federal $7,500 tax credit. This state-level initiative, known as the Light-Duty Motor Vehicle Purchase or Lease Incentive Program (LDPLIP), offers buyers a $2,500 grant for qualifying electric vehicles purchased and registered within the state. The program comes at a pivotal time, as the end of federal incentives has left a gap that could dampen consumer interest in EVs, particularly in a market where affordability remains a key barrier.

Tesla Inc., the Austin-based EV giant, stands to gain significantly from this development. All current Tesla models, including the popular Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X, qualify for the rebate, providing a timely boost to the company's sales momentum in its home state. According to a report from Teslarati, the incentive has become active precisely after the loss of the federal credit, which had been a major draw for EV buyers nationwide.

Tesla's Strategic Positioning in Texas

The LDPLIP is administered by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and targets light-duty vehicles, with funds allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. This structure not only encourages swift action from consumers but also aligns with Tesla's direct-to-consumer sales model, which bypasses traditional dealerships. Industry observers note that this could help Tesla maintain competitive pricing, especially as the company faces increasing rivalry from legacy automakers ramping up their EV offerings.

Further insights from Autoblog highlight how the program is aiding Tesla in sustaining lease deals and overall sales. With the federal credit's phase-out, attributed to policy changes under the current administration, states like Texas are stepping up to fill the void. This rebate applies to both purchases and leases, making it versatile for different buyer profiles, from individual consumers to fleet operators.

Broader Implications for EV Market Dynamics

The incentive's impact extends beyond immediate sales figures. For Tesla, which has its Gigafactory in Texas, this program reinforces the state's role as a hub for EV innovation and manufacturing. Data from the SlashGear analysis indicates that the $2,500 grant could effectively lower the entry price for models like the Model Y, potentially increasing adoption rates in a state known for its vast road networks and high vehicle dependency.

Moreover, this initiative reflects a patchwork of state-level responses to federal policy shifts. While Texas offers this grant, other states like Colorado have introduced similar rebates, creating a varied incentive environment across the U.S. Tesla's ability to leverage such programs is evident in its marketing strategies, where the company prominently features state incentives on its website, as detailed in Tesla's own support page.

Challenges and Future Outlook

However, the program's limited funding -- capped at a certain pool -- means it may not last indefinitely, prompting questions about long-term sustainability. Critics argue that while beneficial for Tesla, it might not sufficiently address broader barriers like charging infrastructure in rural Texas areas. Reports from the Alternative Fuels Data Center outline additional Texas laws and incentives, including those for alternative fuels, which could complement the LDPLIP.

Looking ahead, Tesla's executives have expressed optimism about state-driven incentives compensating for federal losses. As noted in a Drive Tesla article, the rebate even applies retroactively in some cases, benefiting recent buyers. This adaptability could help Tesla navigate economic headwinds, ensuring continued growth in EV penetration.

Economic and Policy Ramifications

Economically, the incentive is poised to stimulate local manufacturing and job creation, given Tesla's significant presence in Texas. The program's design, focusing on vehicles that meet emission standards, aligns with environmental goals, potentially reducing the state's carbon footprint over time.

In summary, Texas's EV incentive represents a pragmatic response to federal changes, with Tesla emerging as a primary beneficiary. As states increasingly take the lead, this could reshape the competitive environment for electric vehicles, fostering innovation and accessibility in unexpected ways.",2025-10-20
Proxy Advisers Oppose Elon Musk's $1 Trillion Tesla Pay Package,"Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation package at Tesla Inc. has sparked intense debate among shareholders and proxy advisers, with critics arguing that the plan fails to guarantee the CEO's undivided attention on the electric-vehicle maker. The package, unveiled last month, ties massive stock awards to ambitious performance milestones, potentially making Musk the world's first trillionaire if Tesla's market value surges to $8.5 trillion over the next decade. However, influential voices in the investment community are raising alarms about its structure and implications.

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has come out strongly against the plan, recommending that Tesla investors vote it down at the upcoming November shareholder meeting. In a report highlighted by Ars Technica, ISS contends that the compensation doesn't include mechanisms to ensure Musk's ""focus and time remain on Tesla,"" especially given his involvement in multiple ventures like SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. This lack of safeguards, critics say, could dilute Musk's commitment to Tesla at a time when the company faces slowing EV sales and intensifying competition.

Concerns Over Dilution and Governance

Glass Lewis, another prominent proxy adviser, echoed these sentiments in a recent analysis, urging shareholders to reject the package due to its ""astronomical"" size and potential for significant shareholder dilution. As detailed in a Bloomberg report, the plan would grant Musk options equivalent to about 10% of Tesla's shares, expanding his voting power and potentially entrenching his control without commensurate accountability. State officials and investor groups, including the SOC Investment Group, have also voiced opposition, filing regulatory documents that warn of the risks to corporate governance.

These criticisms build on earlier pushback, as seen in a Reuters article from early October, where shareholders expressed fears that the package prioritizes Musk's personal wealth over sustainable company growth. Tesla's board defends the plan as essential for retaining Musk's visionary leadership, pointing to past successes where performance-based incentives propelled the company's valuation from $60 billion to over $1 trillion in just a few years.

Market Reactions and Historical Context

Despite the outcry, some market observers believe the package could still pass, buoyed by retail investor enthusiasm and Tesla's stock performance. A Reuters analysis from September suggests that shareholders might overlook the concerns, viewing the plan as a bold bet on Musk's ability to transform Tesla into an AI and robotics leader. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, reflect divided sentiment, with supporters praising the incentive structure and detractors highlighting Musk's divided attentions.

This isn't the first time Musk's pay has stirred controversy. His 2018 package, initially valued at $56 billion, was struck down by a Delaware court but later reinstated after shareholder approval. As covered in a CNN Business piece, the current proposal dwarfs that earlier one, requiring Tesla to achieve milestones like $650 billion in annual revenue and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Critics argue that without explicit commitments to Tesla exclusivity, the plan risks repeating past issues where Musk's focus on other projects, such as acquiring Twitter (now X), coincided with Tesla's operational challenges.

Broader Implications for Executive Compensation

The debate extends beyond Tesla, raising questions about executive pay in the tech sector. If approved, Musk's package could set a precedent for outsized rewards tied to speculative growth, potentially influencing how other companies structure incentives for star CEOs. A Guardian report notes the plan's requirement for Tesla's value to multiply eightfold, a feat that would demand breakthroughs in robotics and AI, areas where Musk has publicly shifted resources to xAI.

Yet, as CNBC points out, the proposal also includes a vote on investing in xAI, blurring lines between Musk's enterprises and raising conflict-of-interest concerns. For industry insiders, this underscores a tension between innovation-driven leadership and fiduciary responsibility. Tesla's board argues that the package aligns Musk's interests with shareholders', but opponents fear it could exacerbate governance risks in an era of concentrated corporate power.

Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

As the November vote approaches, Tesla is ramping up efforts to rally support, including direct appeals to retail investors who own a significant portion of shares. Historical precedents suggest Musk's charisma and track record may sway the outcome, but the mounting criticism from proxy firms and institutional investors could tip the scales. A rejection might force Tesla to renegotiate, potentially leading to a more balanced structure that explicitly addresses focus concerns.

Ultimately, the saga reflects broader shifts in corporate America, where tech titans like Musk wield outsized influence. Whether the package passes or not, it will likely fuel ongoing discussions about equity, accountability, and the true cost of visionary leadership in high-stakes industries.",2025-10-20
"Cathie Wood Backs Musk's $1T Tesla Pay Plan, Eyes Shareholder Win","In the high-stakes world of corporate governance and executive compensation, few figures loom as large as Elon Musk, the mercurial CEO of Tesla Inc. Now, as shareholders prepare for a pivotal vote on November 6, investor Cathie Wood, the influential founder of Ark Invest, has thrown her weight behind Musk's proposed $1 trillion pay package, predicting a ""decisive"" victory. Wood, known for her bold bets on disruptive technologies, argues that retail investors -- often overlooked in boardroom battles -- will tip the scales in Musk's favor, overriding opposition from institutional heavyweights and proxy advisory firms.

This isn't the first rodeo for Musk's compensation saga. The package, which could balloon to $1 trillion based on Tesla's market performance, echoes a 2018 plan that was initially approved by shareholders but later struck down by a Delaware court. Tesla's board has reframed it as a performance-based award tied to ambitious milestones in revenue, profitability, and market capitalization, positioning it as essential for retaining Musk's visionary leadership amid his sprawling empire of ventures, from SpaceX to xAI.

Retail Power and Institutional Pushback: How Individual Investors Could Shape Tesla's Future

Wood's optimism stems from her analysis of Tesla's shareholder base, where retail investors hold significant sway. In a recent interview, she emphasized that these everyday stockholders, many of whom idolize Musk for revolutionizing electric vehicles and autonomous driving, are likely to drown out dissenting voices. According to reporting from Business Insider, Wood described the opposition as ""sad, if not damning,"" particularly criticizing proxy firms like Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) for recommending a ""no"" vote, citing concerns over the package's sheer scale and potential dilution of shares.

Yet, the resistance is formidable. ISS, in its advisory report, argued that the award's magnitude -- potentially granting Musk options worth hundreds of billions -- exceeds reasonable bounds, even for a company that has seen its valuation soar under his tenure. Other critics, including unions and state treasurers, have echoed these sentiments, warning that approving it could set a dangerous precedent for executive pay in an era of widening income inequality. Tesla, however, counters that the plan aligns Musk's incentives with long-term growth, pointing to past achievements like scaling production to millions of vehicles annually.

The Historical Context: From 2018 Approval to Legal Overturns and Renewed Debates

Delving deeper, the roots of this controversy trace back to 2018, when 73% of shareholders greenlit a similar package, only for a judge to void it on grounds of inadequate disclosure and board independence. Musk himself has been vocal on social media, framing the vote as a referendum on innovation versus bureaucracy. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from users like investor Sawyer Merritt highlight widespread support among retail holders, with sentiments echoing Wood's view that denying Musk could ""deprive"" the market of Tesla's edge.

Wood's perspective isn't isolated; it's bolstered by her track record of championing Tesla through volatility. In a piece from Benzinga, she reiterated that Musk's leadership has delivered exponential returns, justifying the outsized reward. Analysts note that if approved, the package could vest in tranches, requiring Tesla to hit a $4 trillion market cap -- a moonshot that would enrich all shareholders proportionally.

Implications for Corporate America: Balancing Innovation with Accountability

Beyond the vote, this episode underscores broader tensions in corporate America, where star CEOs like Musk command cult-like followings but face scrutiny over governance. Proxy firms such as Glass Lewis have also advised against the plan, per reports in Bloomberg, arguing it lacks sufficient performance hurdles. Wood, however, sees it as a test of shareholder democracy, warning that rejection might push Musk toward privatizing Tesla or diverting his energies elsewhere.

For industry insiders, the November 6 outcome could redefine executive incentives in tech. If Wood's prediction holds, it affirms retail investors' growing clout in an era of democratized trading apps. Conversely, a defeat might embolden regulators to impose stricter oversight on mega-compensation deals. As Tesla navigates this crossroads, Musk's trillion-dollar gamble remains a litmus test for ambition in the electric age, with Wood betting big on its success.",2025-10-20
"Tesla expected to beat Q3 estimates on EV deliveries, China recovery","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is set to reports its third quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday after US markets close, with Wedbush analysts anticipating a stronger-than-expected quarter driven by EV deliveries and a rebound in China sales.

""After a brutal few quarters we are finally starting to see stable demand trends for Tesla,"" the analysts believe.

Wedbush projects third quarter total revenue of roughly $26 billion, including automotive revenue near $19 billion, slightly below the Wall Street consensus of $26.45 billion.

Beyond financial measures, Wedbush expects investors to focus on Tesla's broader AI and robotics ambitions.

They expect key topics on the company's earnings call to include the Robotaxi rollout across the US, the volume production trajectory for Cybercabs and Optimus in 2026, and the timing of any new models set to hit the road early next year.

Wedbush also highlighted the upcoming shareholder meeting on November 6, where they expect shareholders to approve Musk's potential $1 trillion pay package and ""importantly lay the groundwork for a major investment in xAI that is a key ingredient in Tesla's broader AI initiatives.""

Looking ahead, Wedbush remains bullish on Tesla's long-term potential in AI and robotics.

Gold's Path To $10K May Start With Blow-Off Top; Market Bets On Trump-China Deal - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Gold's Path To $10K

Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD).

Note the following:

The chart shows the rapid rise in gold as gold now becomes a meme trade. The pattern shown on the chart is one of the many factors that, according to our algorithms show a high probability of a blow-off top in the short term. The plan is to add to the gold position if and when there is a substantial pullback. We have been bullish on gold for the long term from close to the bottom of this cycle near $1000. Our next target for gold is $6000. Prudent investors should know that gold has a path to $10K if the present policies of dollar debasement and financial repression continue. There is nothing on the short term horizon that present policies will change. The stock market is seeing aggressive buying this morning on optimism that President Trump will cut a deal with China this month, ahead of the end of the tariff hike extension. The optimism is leading to the momo crowd buying in rare earth mineral stocks. MP Materials Corp (NYSE:MP), USA Rare Earth Inc (NASDAQ:USAR), and Critical Metals Corp (NASDAQ:CRML) are in our Portfolio. However, buying here does not make sense. If President Trump cuts a rare earth deal with China, it will increase supply of rare earth minerals to the U.S. and rare earth mineral stocks will fall. In addition to rare earth mineral stocks, aggressive buying is coming from the momo crowd focused on quantum computing stocks Rigetti Computing Inc (NASDAQ:RGTI), IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc (NYSE:QBTS) as well as space stocks Rocket Lab Corp (NASDAQ:RKLB) and AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS). eVTOL stocks Archer Aviation Inc (NYSE:ACHR) and Joby Aviation Inc (NYSE:JOBY) are also seeing buying as ACHR signed an agreement to potentially sell 100 Midnight aircraft to Korean Air. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to be released on Friday. China

The latest economic data from China is strong. The data gives leverage to China in trade negotiations with the U.S. Here are the details:

Q3 GDP came at 1.1% quarter-over-quarter vs. 0.8% consensus. Industrial production came at 6.5% year-over-year vs. 5.0% consensus. Japan

There is agreement in Japan to form a coalition government with Sanae Takaichi as the new prime minister. Nikkei 225 rose over 3%.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

Shares of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 4.07% over the past five trading sessions after losing 4.84% the five prior. A rally that began in early summer has finally pushed the stock into the green on the year with a gain of 17.02%. Still, since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, 2024, the stock has fallen 7.54%. When the company last reported earnings in July, it announced that in Q2, revenues were down 12% year over year (YoY), EPS was down 23% YoY, operating income was down 42% YoY and vehicle deliveries fell to 384,122 -- down 14% YoY. Since launching in India in mid-July, Tesla has only received a paltry 600 orders.

Indeed, Tesla's stock has gone through vicious crashes before. And while the stock may not be ready to shift gears from reverse to forward, I do think that a worsening of its latest drawdown could prove a significant buying opportunity, given the chance its drivers could pay off at some point over the medium term. Undoubtedly, the bears may be winning the tug-of-war on the stock now, as Elon Musk's role at DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) becomes old news as hype surrounding Musk's friendship with Trump begins to fade. However, with EV competition mounting and a Jeff Bezos-backed startup entering the scene, Tesla's outlook remains clouded.

In any case, 24/7 Wall St. dove into the lengthy list of drivers and potholes that investors should look forward to (or fasten their seatbelts for) in the coming year and beyond. Let's check out a bull, bear, and base case for the EV titan and have a glimpse at the varied viewpoints of multiple Wall Street pros. In fact, Tesla stock has a ton of table-pounding bulls in addition to massive bears. While not everyone is the biggest fan of Elon Musk, I do think it's a mistake to discount his ability to keep running with the ball into the endzone with disruptive innovations that, while costly in the near term, could prove revolutionary over the longer term.

Tesla's Top Two Growth Drivers Are Still Humming Along

Undoubtedly, Tesla has a front-row seat to the AI revolution. More specifically, it's one of the frontrunners in physical AI (or robotics, if you prefer). In a prior piece, I highlighted Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas' view that TSLA stock was akin to an embodied ""AI ETF"" given the numerous AI projects going on behind the scenes.

Though Tesla's AI efforts are exciting, it's important to note that being too soon to a trend could have a drastic negative impact on the stock. As investors reset expectations and become more critical of how firms spend money on AI, Tesla will need to deliver more substance if it's to convince investors to punch their ticket to the stock well ahead of time. Personally, I think Tesla's been investing in the right areas, but will competitors beat Tesla to market in certain categories?

The most notable drivers, I believe, that will drive Tesla stock in the coming years are the Cybertruck (as well as self-driving capabilities and the impact on the robotaxi market) and its Optimus robot. Of course, there's also the rumored ""Model Q"" entry-level offering. But until we get more clarity on that driver, I consider it to be more of a ""wild card.""

Bull Case for Tesla's Share Price

Cybertruck: The Cybertruck stole the show during Tesla's robotaxi event. While it would be a sci-fi dream for many to have a fairly reasonably priced robotaxi producing passive income for its owners, I do think Musk's vision of the robotaxi future could be a reality within Trump's term. Of course, a more realistic timeframe would put such a future more than 10 years out.

However, if Tesla can floor it on full self-driving (FSD) efforts, perhaps such a future could be closer to the present. There's a great deal of uncertainty with FSD, given the technical and regulatory unknowns. Either way, I view Musk's friendship with Trump as a boon for a Cybertruck rollout under his administration.

If Cybertruck expands its presence and becomes a hit within years rather than decades, TSLA stock could prove a bargain, given all that there is to gain. The big question, though, is how Cybercab will hold its own as Waymo pushes ahead with its impressive offering. Given robotaxis, like generative AI, are unlikely to be a ""winner takes all"" market, I think there's no reason why both robotaxi offerings can't win big from prime-time adoption of self-driving.

Another big question to consider is whether consumers will be interested in buying up Cybercabs to have them rolling around on the streets as ride-hailers. I think the business could prove quite lucrative for buyers and Tesla's margins over the long haul. After all, it can sell the car and continue to build a ride-hailing network while profiting from use of a ride-hailing app of sorts.

Cathie Wood thinks autonomous ride-hailing could represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. If Tesla can get a nice slice, Wood sees TSLA stock at $2,600 per share by 2029. Personally, I think the bull case (for the year ahead) could see TSLA at around $550 per share -- or 23.91% higher than where the stock is trading today. That target is shared by Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, one of my favorite analysts in tech.

Optimus: Optimus was a nice addition to the robotaxis event as it amused attendees. But the big question is how much potential the robot has once it's ready to go on sale to the general public.

Undoubtedly, Tesla isn't the only one getting into the robotics game. Many Mag Seven members also investing heavily in home robots. While more rivals in home robots could be a threat to Optimus, I view it as more of a confirmation that there is a place in the home for such profound innovations.

As for the home robotics market, I do see 2026 as a tad overly optimistic for a launch. However, if robot ""friends"" do arrive by 2030, I think Tesla's growth rate could reaccelerate back to or even above 25% to 30% for some amount of time.

Analysts' Upgrades: So far this fall and during summer, the EV firm underwent a series of price target revisions from analysts. Stifel raised its price target on Tesla to $483 from $440 keeping its ""Buy"" rating while citing progress in its Robotaxi network. Canaccord raised its price target on Tesla to $490 from $333 keeping its ""Buy"" rating. In September, Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla to $450 from $375 while keeping an ""Outperform"" rating. In July, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on TSLA to $315 from $285 while maintaining a ""Neutral"" rating. Benchmark raised its price target on TSLA to $475 from $350 while maintaining a ""Buy"" rating following the successful launch of Tesla's robotaxi business in Austin. UBS raised its price target on TSLA to $215 from $190 but maintained its ""Sell"" rating.

Bear Case for Tesla's Share Price

Cybertruck: Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of work to do before Cybertruck makes an impact on the car market. FSD capabilities need to step things up and the vehicle needs to be made in a way that won't break the bank. These are big asks. Some bears have doubts about whether the firm can execute the opportunity. In late March, the company announced that it was recalling nearly every Cybertruck due to a potential crash risk. This was an enormous blow to Musk's ambitions for the EV, which has already been subjected to harsh criticism about its perceived shortcomings among owners.

Bad Press: Musk's deteriorated image at the hands of his federal government involvement with DOGE aside, Tesla has continued to bear the brunt of bad news. In late 2024, it was widely reported that the EV maker was the most dangerous vehicle brand, with the number of deaths among all automakers, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. According to the study, Tesla has a fatal accident rate of 5.6 per billion vehicle miles, compared to the overall average of just 2.8. Additionally, ongoing protests against the brand -- including vandalism and arson -- have occurred around the globe, from Italy and France to numerous states in the U.S.

Optimus: Even if home robots are on the horizon, good luck asking consumers to spend thousands on a proven technology. Indeed, if Vision Pro taught us anything, it's that being an early adopter is expensive and probably not the best use of funds. Either way, I'd much rather wait and see how the robot ambitions pan out before getting too excited at this stage.

Insider & Institutional Activity: There's an old adage on Wall Street that suggests investors should ""follow the money."" If that's the current case for Tesla, money is flowing out. In fact, over the past three months, not a single share of TSLA has been purchased by insiders (e.g., the company's executives, directors or anyone who owns 10% or more of the company), and over the past 12 months, there has only been one insider purchase, according to Nasdaq.com. Data from Finviz supports this, even showing that Musk himself, as well as his brother, have been offloading shares since late 2024. Additionally, institutional ownership has now decreased to 47.92%. In total, 140 institutional investors have entirely liquidated their Tesla positions.

Increased competition: Also in April, a Jeff Bezos-backed EV company called Slate unveiled affordable EV truck and SUV models, which the company aims to sell at a cost of around $30,000. The company has billed itself as the ""anti-Tesla,"" and is made in the U.S. As Tesla's market share has fallen under 50% in EV-friendly California, the arrival of Slate could continue to erode sales.

Base Case for Tesla's Share Price

Much of Tesla's story depends on its big growth drivers. In the meantime, EV sales and the rise of more affordable models (Model Q) could be nearer-term stories to look forward to as one waits for the biggest of drivers to pay off. At the time of writing, TSLA stock goes for 194.04 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 15.51 times froward price-to-sales (P/S). That makes the name slightly undervalued, at least in my view.",2025-10-20
"Leveraged ETF Boom Raises Red Flags, Expert Warns - Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)","With the U.S. ETF market headed for a record-setting year of new product launches, fears are growing that the industry is sliding toward speculative excess. Morningstar analyst Daniel Sotiroff thinks leveraged ETFs are right in the middle of it.

In the first nine months of 2025 alone, nearly 800 new ETFs have hit the market, surpassing 2024's full-year record of 746. The total could top 1,000 before year-end, according to Reuters data, a staggering pace that has prompted even insiders to warn of ""an unsustainable level of launches.""

Sotiroff agrees, but with sharper words.

""Most of the ETFs launched this year don't really serve a legitimate long-term purpose,"" he told Benzinga. ""I suspect they'll eventually shut down, though it may take longer than three years for some of them.""

The Speculative Surge

While industry leaders cite growing investor choice and innovation, Sotiroff sees something more troubling behind the wave of leveraged and single-stock ETF filings.

""I don't think it's genuine investor demand or a supply gap,"" he said. ""A lot of these launches are aimed at creating speculative ETFs that attract naïve users. The creators and users are gambling and expecting a huge payoff. What they're doing is the exact opposite of investing.""

Leveraged ETFs -- products designed to multiply daily returns, often by two or three times -- have become increasingly aggressive. The recent filing by VolatilityShares to launch 5x leveraged ETFs tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Strategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Solana shocked even veteran analysts.

""That filing was mind-blowing,"" Sotiroff said. ""About half of the leveraged ETFs launched more than three years ago have shut down, and another 17% of them have lost 98% of their value. The 5x leveraged ETFs are just amplifying those risks.""

A Market Of Extremes

At the end of September, around 1,600 ETFs held less than $50 million in assets, a red flag for survival.

""ETFs with very little AUM are the most vulnerable to shutting down,"" Sotiroff noted. ""I suspect most of those aren't going to live very long.""

While speculative enthusiasm remains, the segment's scale is limited relative to the broader $13 trillion U.S. ETF market.

""Leveraged and derivative-based ETFs are attracting some money,"" Sotiroff said, ""but they account for a relatively small segment of the net inflows across all ETFs.""

Still, the combination of easy regulatory pathways, copycat product design, and retail speculation is fueling a market dynamic that Sotiroff believes will end badly for many participants. ""Leveraged ETFs perform poorly over long periods,"" he warned. ""Eventually, the leverage works against them, and it becomes almost impossible for them to recover.""

Retail At The Front Lines

Financial advisers, meanwhile, remain wary of small or risky funds, leaving retail investors disproportionately exposed.

""It's not new for advisors to avoid small ETFs,"" Sotiroff said. ""Unfortunately, a lot of the leveraged ETFs have largely been aimed at retail investors who don't know what they're getting into.""

As leveraged ETF filings continue to multiply, and issuers test the SEC's appetite for even higher leverage, Sotiroff's warning cuts through the noise: the ETF market may not be in a bubble yet, but parts of it are starting to look like a casino.

The company has started delivering its new Gravity SUV in Canada, expanding its North American presence with a model offering over 720 km of range and access to Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Supercharger network.

The company is also targeting 18,000-20,000 vehicles in 2025 production and advancing a multi-million-dollar partnership with Uber Technologies, Inc (NYSE:UBER) to deploy 20,000 Lucid Robotaxis across major U.S. cities -- a move aimed at driving volume, brand visibility, and long-term value creation.

LCID Price Action: Lucid stock was trading higher by 1.22% to $19.87 at last check Monday.

"Market Collapsed 23% 38 Years Ago, Would Be 11,000 Points Today","I watched it happen. On October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 508 points, which was 22.6%. It fell from 2,246.74 at the open to 1,738.74 at the close on the day known as Black Monday. Such a drop would be just shy of 11,000 points today. The market was actually worse than that when taken over two days. The Dow had dropped almost 5% the Friday before. The anxiety over the weekend between the two was terrific.

Just before the retreat, there was a concern about U.S. trade deficits. Congress had just begun to talk about whether M&A activity had tax rates that were too low. Interest rates had been rising. However, the primary cause was wider. Many traders believed that the market was too expensive. Famous economist Robert Shiller thought, according to the University of Chicago, the explanation for the drop was that ""the crash was as much a sociological or psychological phenomenon as an economic one.""

The overvaluation explanation was based on factors that are somewhat like the current market situation. The value of the Dow rose 67% from January 1985 to the middle of 1987. Over our most recent three years, it is up about 57%.

The primary question about whether the market will drop sharply today will not be measured by the Dow. That yardstick is too narrow now. The S&P 500 is a much better metric. And, within the S&P 500, the Magnificent 7 stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) are 34% of the entire value of the index.

There are already cracks in the valuations of the seven stocks. This is certainly true of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the price of which is only up 2% this year. This is largely because it does not have a high-end artificial intelligence product, while the valuation of AI-based companies is soaring. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has also been a laggard. It is up 9% this year, to some extent because of the political leanings of CEO Elon Musk. Additionally, there is a debate about whether Tesla is a car company or an AI and robotics operation.

At the absolute core of the value of the world's most valuable stocks is the future of AI. The earnings of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are based almost entirely on whether their bets on AI are correct. Each has already said it will spend tens of billions of dollars on AI data centers this year and next. At the core of the value premise today is whether AI is a product people will pay for or one that is given away almost entirely for free.

Early answers about the future of AI will be part of the earnings and forecasts for the third quarter of this year. If these are shaky, the market will rest downward, perhaps by a staggering amount.",2025-10-20

Robotics and AI Drive a New Era of Growth and Uplisting Activity,"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide, from manufacturing and logistics to hospitality and food service. As these sectors expand, small-cap companies are increasingly using acquisitions to scale operations, generate measurable revenue and strengthen their technological capabilities. This strategic growth not only positions these companies to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market but also sets the stage for uplisting from over-the-counter (OTC) markets to national exchanges. Uplisting offers broader visibility, institutional investment opportunities and the resources necessary to accelerate the deployment of AI and robotics innovations. Nightfood Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: NGTF) (Profile), doing business as TechForce Robotics, exemplifies this approach. By completing targeted acquisitions, the company has built a platform that integrates revenue-generating assets with AI-enabled robotics technology. Nightfood Holdings now reports more than $10 million in annualized revenue and a combined acquisition value estimated at approximately $100 million, positioning it to move from expansion to execution as an exchange-ready entity. Nightfood is focused on becoming a significant player in the robotics and AI space, joining other key leaders, such as including NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ: RR) and iRobot Corp. (NASDAQ: IRBT).

Uplisting provides emerging companies with broader visibility and access to a deeper investor base. For small-cap technology firms, including those in robotics and AI, transitioning to a national exchange such as NASDAQ or NYSE American enhances credibility and can facilitate access to capital markets. Uplisting also requires more rigorous reporting standards, which can increase investor confidence in both financials and governance practices.

Data demonstrates that companies undergoing uplisting often experience growth in both trading volume and institutional interest. For robotics and AI firms, this is particularly significant, as these sectors demand long-term investment to fund research, development and deployment of advanced automation solutions. Enhanced market credibility can directly support strategic partnerships and business development initiatives.

Industry forecasts reinforce the importance of scale in AI and robotics. Grand View Research reports that the global service robotics market was valued at approximately $47 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $107 billion by 2030, growing at a 12.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) Companies that achieve uplisting readiness are better positioned to capture market share in this rapidly expanding environment. ""The service robotics has witnessed growing penetration in various sectors owing to factors including precise services, low-cost solutions, flexibility and reduction of human efforts,"" Grandview noted.

For small-cap firms in this growing sector, achieving a national exchange listing signals operational maturity and can attract institutional investors seeking exposure to emerging AI-enabled technologies. Uplisting can also improve liquidity for shareholders, enhance company valuation and provide the foundation for continued acquisitions and strategic growth initiatives.

Nightfood Reaches Uplisting Readiness

Nightfood Holdings reports that its completion of targeted acquisitions has enabled the company to meet key criteria for uplisting. By consolidating strategic assets, the company has built a foundation for operational scale, institutional visibility and regulatory compliance consistent with national exchange requirements.

Recent acquisitions have expanded Nightfood's capabilities in AI-powered hospitality and automation. Most recently, the company announced the successful closing of its fifth acquisition in under two years with the completion of its share exchange transaction to acquire Treasure Mountain Holdings LLC, the owner and operator of the 120-room Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, California. The transaction was valued at approximately $52.8 million.

Last month the company officially closed on the acquisition of Victorville Treasure Holdings, LLC, the owner of a 155-room Holiday Inn property in Victorville, California. The $31 million share exchange agreement (SEA) represented Nightfood's first completed hotel acquisition. Together, the Rancho Mirage and Victorville acquisitions form the foundation of Nightfood's AI-driven hospitality platform, positioning the company at the forefront of automation in hotel operations.

The hotel acquisitions followed two acquisition announcements made earlier this year: Carryout Supplies, a custom packaging provider that enhances vertical integration across its service ecosystem valued at $10 million, and Skytech Automated Solutions, a $6-million-plus acquisition that bolsters the company's leadership in hotel automation systems. These moves consolidate the company's operational footprint, creating a more integrated platform for deploying AI and robotics technologies. Nightfood now operates across multiple revenue streams while building a foundation for scalability, a critical factor for national exchange eligibility.

The company's acquisition strategy also aligns with investor expectations for small-cap technology firms seeking uplisting. With recurring revenue streams in place from its hotel properties and the high-margin potential of its AI-driven robotics initiatives, Nightfood is strategically aligned to meet uplisting requirements and the company is preparing for its planned uplisting to a national exchange.

Annual Revenue Exceeds $10 Million

Nightfood Holdings now generates more than $10 million in annualized revenue, driven by a diversified portfolio of assets including operating hotels and its packaging subsidiary. The company noted that reaching this $10-million milestone marks its evolution into a high-growth, revenue-generating enterprise built on the integration of recently closed hotel acquisitions and its expanding Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform.

""Reaching the $10 million annualized revenue mark represents a defining milestone and validates our integrated growth model,"" said Nightfood CEO Jimmy Chan. ""Our hotel acquisitions and RaaS platform are working in tandem to deliver measurable results and create long-term shareholder value. We remain focused on executing our roadmap and scaling our presence in the rapidly evolving hospitality automation market.""

The two hotel acquisitions serve as a cornerstone in Nightfood Holdings' evolution into a next-generation technology and asset company. These properties ""create a growing network of AI-connected, real-world deployment environments where [Nightfood's] service robots are being tested, refined, and commercialized,"" the company noted, with each location strengthening both sides of the company's model.

On the balance sheet, these asset-backed real estate holdings enhance book value, stability and collateral strength, while operationally, every hotel serves as a live testbed and proof-of-concept site for the company's RaaS technology, integrating AI-driven automation into high-traffic environments such as hospitality, retail, education and healthcare.

""Together, these acquisitions form a vertically integrated platform that blends tangible assets with scalable robotics innovation, positioning [Nightfood] to become a pioneer in the AI-automation sector,"" the company noted. Carryout Supplies adds a complementary revenue stream and vertical integration, enhancing the company's operational resilience and providing cash flow to support further technology deployment.

A Transformative Leap Forward

Nightfood Holdings's recent acquisitions collectively represent approximately $100 million in transaction value. These acquisitions include both hospitality properties and strategic technology companies that reinforce the company's robotics and AI platform. The Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn acquisitions form the foundation of the company's hospitality and AI automation network, while Carryout Supplies and Skytech Automated Solutions strengthen Nightfood's vertical integration and technology capabilities.

""Closing the Skytech acquisition represents a transformative leap forward for Nightfood,"" said Nightfood chair Jamie Steigerwald, announcing the acquisition earlier this year. ""This strengthens our ability to scale automation across the hospitality industry -- addressing key operational pain points such as labor shortages and rising costs. Together with the Carryout Supplies acquisition, we're building a powerful ecosystem designed to lead the future of hotel automation.""

This disciplined merger and acquisition strategy enables Nightfood to scale operations efficiently and demonstrate verified market impact, two factors critical for institutional visibility and investor confidence.

AI and Robotics Drive Next-Generation Innovations

The robotics and artificial intelligence sectors are advancing at a rapid pace, with companies introducing new technologies that push the boundaries of automation, computing power and intelligent decision-making. These innovations demonstrate the growing impact of AI and robotics on both everyday life and global interactions.

NVIDIA Corp. will start shipping its DGX Spark(TM), the world's smallest AI supercomputer.

According to the company, AI workloads are quickly outgrowing the memory and software capabilities of the PCs, workstations and laptops millions of developers rely on today, forcing teams to shift work to the cloud or local data centers. As a new class of computer, DGX Spark delivers a petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a compact desktop form factor, giving developers the power to run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally. In addition, DGX Spark lets developers create AI agents and run advanced software stacks locally.

Tesla Inc. is committed to develop and deploy autonomy at scale in vehicles, robots and more. The company believes that an approach based on advanced AI for vision and planning, supported by efficient use of inference hardware, is the only way to achieve a general solution for full self-driving, bipedal robotics and beyond. The company is developing the Optimus robot, a general-purpose, bipedal, autonomous humanoid robot capable of performing unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.

Richtech Robotics Inc. has signed a multimillion-dollar sales agreement with Beijing Tongchuang Technology Development Co. Ltd. Valued at more than $4 million and completed by its Chinese joint venture, Boyu Artificial Intelligence Technology Co. Ltd., the agreement includes the purchase, service and software licensing of products from three of Richtech's key product lines: ADAM, Scorpion and Titan. The deal expands the company's footprint in China and opens the door for additional potential opportunities across the Asian market.

iRobot Corp. introduced its most powerful and intelligent two-in-one robot to date: the Roomba(R) Max 705 Combo Robot + AutoWash(TM) Dock. Designed for the busiest homes, the Roomba Max 705 Combo delivers a deep, hands-free clean with 175x more power-lifting suction, AI-driven technology to avoid clutter left by kids and pets, and a first-of-its-kind roller mop cover that keeps carpets dry.

As AI and robotics continue to evolve, companies are expanding both the capabilities and accessibility of intelligent systems. From high-performance AI platforms to autonomous machines and smarter consumer products, these technologies are reshaping how work, tasks and daily routines are performed. The ongoing progress in this sector signals significant potential for increased productivity, efficiency and convenience across industries worldwide, including hospitality.

MLTX SECURITIES NEWS: MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: MLTX) Faces Securities Fraud Allegations after Stock Drops 90% -- Contact BFA Law by December 15 Class Action Deadline,"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (NASDAQ: MLTX) and certain of the Company's senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in MoonLake, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/moonlake-immunotherapeutics.

Investors have until December 15, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MoonLake common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Bridgewood v. MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, et al., No. 1:25-cv-08500.

Why Was MoonLake Sued for Securities Fraud?

MoonLake is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing therapies for inflammatory diseases. During the relevant period, MoonLake conducted highly anticipated Phase 3 VELA trials for sonelokimab (""SLK""), an investigational therapeutic designed to treat adult participants with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (""HS"").

MoonLake told investors that its ""strong clinical data,"" including results from its Phase 2 MIRA trial, translate into ""higher clinical responses for patients, and provide ample opportunity for differentiation of sonelokimab versus all competitors."" The Company also stated that SLK's Nanobody structure differed in beneficial ways from traditional monoclonal antibody treatments from its competitors.

As alleged, in truth, the Company's clinical data and Nanobody structure did not confer a superior clinical benefit over its competitors, calling into question the drug's chances for regulatory approval and commercial viability.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On September 28, 2025, MoonLake reported its week 16 results of the VELA Phase 3 trials. The Company reported disappointing results for both trials, with VELA-2 failing to meet its primary endpoint, calling into question the drug's chances for regulatory approval and commercial viability. On this news, the price of MoonLake stock fell $55.75 per share, or nearly 90%, from $61.99 per share on September 26, 2025, to $6.24 per share on September 29, 2025, the following trading day.

(NYSE:KMX) for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in CarMax, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/carmax-inc-class-action.

Why Is CarMax being Investigated?

CarMax sells used cars. During the relevant period, the Company touted the strong and sustainable demand for its cars, driven by factors such as a seamless customer experience. CarMax also stated that it had properly assessed and reserved for the risk of the car loans it previously issued to customers.

In truth, it appears that the announcement of U.S. tariffs imposed on cars provided a short-term boost to demand, as customers purchased cars prior to the tariffs taking effect, and CarMax had not properly assessed or reserved for its portfolio of car loans.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On September 25, 2025, the Company reported disappointing financial results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Specifically, CarMax announced sales declines across the board, including a 5.4% decline in retail used unit sales, a 6.3% decline in comparable store used unit sales, and a 2.2% decline in wholesale units. The Company also posted a disappointing Q2 net earnings of about $95.4 million, down from $132.8 million over the prior year. A main reason for the declines, according to CarMax, was a ""pull forward"" in demand into Q1 due to the announcement of tariffs. CarMax further reported an 11.2% decrease in income from its financing segment year-over-year, which it attributed to a loan loss provision for the quarter of $142.2 million.

On this news, the price of CarMax stock fell $11.45 per share, or roughly 20%, from $57.05 per share on September 24, 2025, to $45.60 per share on September 25, 2025.

Robotics and AI Drive a New Era of Growth and Uplisting Activity,"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 /CNW/ -- The integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide, from manufacturing and logistics to hospitality and food service. As these sectors expand, small-cap companies are increasingly using acquisitions to scale operations, generate measurable revenue and strengthen their technological capabilities. This strategic growth not only positions these companies to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market but also sets the stage for uplisting from over-the-counter (OTC) markets to national exchanges. Uplisting offers broader visibility, institutional investment opportunities and the resources necessary to accelerate the deployment of AI and robotics innovations. Nightfood Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: NGTF) (Profile), doing business as TechForce Robotics, exemplifies this approach. By completing targeted acquisitions, the company has built a platform that integrates revenue-generating assets with AI-enabled robotics technology. Nightfood Holdings now reports more than $10 million in annualized revenue and a combined acquisition value estimated at approximately $100 million, positioning it to move from expansion to execution as an exchange-ready entity. Nightfood is focused on becoming a significant player in the robotics and AI space, joining other key leaders, such as including NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ: RR) and iRobot Corp. (NASDAQ: IRBT).

Uplisting provides emerging companies with broader visibility and access to a deeper investor base. For small-cap technology firms, including those in robotics and AI, transitioning to a national exchange such as NASDAQ or NYSE American enhances credibility and can facilitate access to capital markets. Uplisting also requires more rigorous reporting standards, which can increase investor confidence in both financials and governance practices.

Data demonstrates that companies undergoing uplisting often experience growth in both trading volume and institutional interest. For robotics and AI firms, this is particularly significant, as these sectors demand long-term investment to fund research, development and deployment of advanced automation solutions. Enhanced market credibility can directly support strategic partnerships and business development initiatives.

Industry forecasts reinforce the importance of scale in AI and robotics. Grand View Research reports that the global service robotics market was valued at approximately $47 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $107 billion by 2030, growing at a 12.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) Companies that achieve uplisting readiness are better positioned to capture market share in this rapidly expanding environment. ""The service robotics has witnessed growing penetration in various sectors owing to factors including precise services, low-cost solutions, flexibility and reduction of human efforts,"" Grandview noted.

For small-cap firms in this growing sector, achieving a national exchange listing signals operational maturity and can attract institutional investors seeking exposure to emerging AI-enabled technologies. Uplisting can also improve liquidity for shareholders, enhance company valuation and provide the foundation for continued acquisitions and strategic growth initiatives.

Nightfood Reaches Uplisting Readiness

Nightfood Holdings reports that its completion of targeted acquisitions has enabled the company to meet key criteria for uplisting. By consolidating strategic assets, the company has built a foundation for operational scale, institutional visibility and regulatory compliance consistent with national exchange requirements.

Recent acquisitions have expanded Nightfood's capabilities in AI-powered hospitality and automation. Most recently, the company announced the successful closing of its fifth acquisition in under two years with the completion of its share exchange transaction to acquire Treasure Mountain Holdings LLC, the owner and operator of the 120-room Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, California. The transaction was valued at approximately $52.8 million.

Last month the company officially closed on the acquisition of Victorville Treasure Holdings, LLC, the owner of a 155-room Holiday Inn property in Victorville, California. The $31 million share exchange agreement (SEA) represented Nightfood's first completed hotel acquisition. Together, the Rancho Mirage and Victorville acquisitions form the foundation of Nightfood's AI-driven hospitality platform, positioning the company at the forefront of automation in hotel operations.

The hotel acquisitions followed two acquisition announcements made earlier this year: Carryout Supplies, a custom packaging provider that enhances vertical integration across its service ecosystem valued at $10 million, and Skytech Automated Solutions, a $6-million-plus acquisition that bolsters the company's leadership in hotel automation systems. These moves consolidate the company's operational footprint, creating a more integrated platform for deploying AI and robotics technologies. Nightfood now operates across multiple revenue streams while building a foundation for scalability, a critical factor for national exchange eligibility.

The company's acquisition strategy also aligns with investor expectations for small-cap technology firms seeking uplisting. With recurring revenue streams in place from its hotel properties and the high-margin potential of its AI-driven robotics initiatives, Nightfood is strategically aligned to meet uplisting requirements and the company is preparing for its planned uplisting to a national exchange.

Annual Revenue Exceeds $10 Million

Nightfood Holdings now generates more than $10 million in annualized revenue, driven by a diversified portfolio of assets including operating hotels and its packaging subsidiary. The company noted that reaching this $10-million milestone marks its evolution into a high-growth, revenue-generating enterprise built on the integration of recently closed hotel acquisitions and its expanding Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform.

""Reaching the $10 million annualized revenue mark represents a defining milestone and validates our integrated growth model,"" said Nightfood CEO Jimmy Chan. ""Our hotel acquisitions and RaaS platform are working in tandem to deliver measurable results and create long-term shareholder value. We remain focused on executing our roadmap and scaling our presence in the rapidly evolving hospitality automation market.""

The two hotel acquisitions serve as a cornerstone in Nightfood Holdings' evolution into a next-generation technology and asset company. These properties ""create a growing network of AI-connected, real-world deployment environments where [Nightfood's] service robots are being tested, refined, and commercialized,"" the company noted, with each location strengthening both sides of the company's model.

On the balance sheet, these asset-backed real estate holdings enhance book value, stability and collateral strength, while operationally, every hotel serves as a live testbed and proof-of-concept site for the company's RaaS technology, integrating AI-driven automation into high-traffic environments such as hospitality, retail, education and healthcare.

""Together, these acquisitions form a vertically integrated platform that blends tangible assets with scalable robotics innovation, positioning [Nightfood] to become a pioneer in the AI-automation sector,"" the company noted. Carryout Supplies adds a complementary revenue stream and vertical integration, enhancing the company's operational resilience and providing cash flow to support further technology deployment.

A Transformative Leap Forward

Nightfood Holdings's recent acquisitions collectively represent approximately $100 million in transaction value. These acquisitions include both hospitality properties and strategic technology companies that reinforce the company's robotics and AI platform. The Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn acquisitions form the foundation of the company's hospitality and AI automation network, while Carryout Supplies and Skytech Automated Solutions strengthen Nightfood's vertical integration and technology capabilities.

""Closing the Skytech acquisition represents a transformative leap forward for Nightfood,"" said Nightfood chair Jamie Steigerwald, announcing the acquisition earlier this year. ""This strengthens our ability to scale automation across the hospitality industry -- addressing key operational pain points such as labor shortages and rising costs. Together with the Carryout Supplies acquisition, we're building a powerful ecosystem designed to lead the future of hotel automation.""

This disciplined merger and acquisition strategy enables Nightfood to scale operations efficiently and demonstrate verified market impact, two factors critical for institutional visibility and investor confidence. It also underscores the company's capacity to execute on complex acquisitions while maintaining operational coherence. By combining this array of assets under one platform, Nightfood Holdings positions itself to capitalize on growth opportunities in both AI-enabled robotics and real-world service environments. The scale of acquisitions also supports future expansion and continued technological integration.

Looking Ahead: Scaling Robotics and AI

The robotics and AI sectors are poised for significant growth, with emerging technologies transforming operational efficiency across multiple industries, including hospitality. Nightfood Holdings represents a clear example of how small-cap companies can leverage strategic acquisitions to achieve scale, revenue visibility, and exchange-readiness.

With reported acquisition values exceeding $100 million and annualized revenue surpassing $10 million, Nightfood Holdings has positioned itself as a technology-driven platform capable of deploying AI solutions at scale. Its portfolio, spanning hospitality, packaging and automation technology, provides both cash-flow stability and real-world testing opportunities.

Looking forward, Nightfood Holdings intends to continue integrating its assets, expanding automation deployment across hospitality operations and executing on initiatives that support its uplisting objectives. The company's trajectory reflects the broader trend of AI and robotics firms combining technological innovation with tangible operational assets to enhance market positioning.

As AI-enabled robotics continues to reshape industries globally, Nightfood Holdings exemplifies how small-cap companies can achieve credibility, scale and visibility, key ingredients for sustained growth and exchange-ready readiness.

AI and Robotics Drive Next-Generation Innovations

The robotics and artificial intelligence sectors are advancing at a rapid pace, with companies introducing new technologies that push the boundaries of automation, computing power and intelligent decision-making. These innovations demonstrate the growing impact of AI and robotics on both everyday life and global interactions.

NVIDIA Corp. will start shipping its DGX Spark(TM), the world's smallest AI supercomputer.

According to the company, AI workloads are quickly outgrowing the memory and software capabilities of the PCs, workstations and laptops millions of developers rely on today, forcing teams to shift work to the cloud or local data centers. As a new class of computer, DGX Spark delivers a petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a compact desktop form factor, giving developers the power to run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally. In addition, DGX Spark lets developers create AI agents and run advanced software stacks locally.

Tesla Inc. is committed to develop and deploy autonomy at scale in vehicles, robots and more. The company believes that an approach based on advanced AI for vision and planning, supported by efficient use of inference hardware, is the only way to achieve a general solution for full self-driving, bipedal robotics and beyond. The company is developing the Optimus robot, a general-purpose, bipedal, autonomous humanoid robot capable of performing unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.

Richtech Robotics Inc. has signed a multimillion-dollar sales agreement with Beijing Tongchuang Technology Development Co. Ltd. Valued at more than $4 million and completed by its Chinese joint venture, Boyu Artificial Intelligence Technology Co. Ltd., the agreement includes the purchase, service and software licensing of products from three of Richtech's key product lines: ADAM, Scorpion and Titan. The deal expands the company's footprint in China and opens the door for additional potential opportunities across the Asian market.

iRobot Corp. introduced its most powerful and intelligent two-in-one robot to date: the Roomba(R) Max 705 Combo Robot + AutoWash(TM) Dock. Designed for the busiest homes, the Roomba Max 705 Combo delivers a deep, hands-free clean with 175x more power-lifting suction, AI-driven technology to avoid clutter left by kids and pets, and a first-of-its-kind roller mop cover that keeps carpets dry.

As AI and robotics continue to evolve, companies are expanding both the capabilities and accessibility of intelligent systems. From high-performance AI platforms to autonomous machines and smarter consumer products, these technologies are reshaping how work, tasks and daily routines are performed. The ongoing progress in this sector signals significant potential for increased productivity, efficiency and convenience across industries worldwide, including hospitality.

Faces a Securities Fraud Investigation after Stock Drops 26% -- Contact BFA Law if You Suffered Losses","NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces an investigation into Simulations Plus, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLP) for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Simulations Plus, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/simulations-plus-inc-class-action-lawsuit.

Why Is Simulations Plus being Investigated?

Simulations Plus is a software company that develops tools for modeling and simulation in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical industries. In June 2024, Simulations Plus acquired Pro-ficiency Holdings, Inc., a provider of simulation-based learning, intelligence and compliance solutions.

During the relevant period, Simulations Plus touted the integration of Pro-ficiency and represented that the acquisition would double its total addressable market and was meaningfully contributing to sales. Simulations Plus also certified that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective. In truth, it appears Simulations Plus struggled to successfully integrate Pro-ficiency and lacked effective internal controls.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On April 15, 2025, the Company hired Grant Thornton LLP as its new auditor. Less than two months later, on June 11, 2025, Simulations Plus announced disappointing preliminary financial results for 3Q 2025 citing purported ""[m]arket uncertainties surrounding funding, drug prices and potential tariffs"" as ""significant headwinds."" On this news, the price of Simulations Plus stock fell $6.39 per share, or more than 24%, from $26.44 per share on June 11, 2025, to $20.05 per share on June 12, 2025.

Then, on July 14, 2025, Simulations Plus reported its 3Q 25 financial results which included a $77.2 million charge ""related to prior acquisitions."" The next day, Simulations Plus reported that it had dismissed Grant Thornton. When discussing the dismissal, Simulations Plus stated that ""the Company (i) reviewed certain matters regarding segment reporting and reporting unit determinations, that it determined could not be finalized in time . . . , (ii) evaluated internal controls over financial reporting related to Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(a) compliance, concluding they could not be finalized timely [], and (iii) there were no 'reportable events' as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.""

However, Simulations Plus also revealed that the auditor disagreed with the Company's characterizations and that, according to Grant Thornton, ""[it] identified and communicated certain matters to management and the Audit Committee related to segment reporting and reporting unit determinations as well as internal controls over financial reporting. . . . These matters were not resolved to our satisfaction as of the date of our termination.""

On the news of the impairment charge, the dismissal of Grant Thornton, and the auditor's findings, the price of Simulation Plus stock declined $4.50 per share, nearly 26%, from $17.47 per share on June 14, 2025, to $12.97 per share on June 15, 2025.

During the relevant period, the Company stated that Premier Protein ""hit an all-time high in household penetration"" and that ""demand remains strong."" The Company also stated that its growth was ""strong in all channels,"" driven by ""distribution expansion, accelerating velocities and incremental promotional activity.""

In truth, the Company's sales growth during the relevant period may have been driven by temporary trade inventory loading at several key retailers, not sustainable end-consumer demand.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On May 5, 2025, after market hours, BellRing revealed that starting in Q2 2023, ""several key retailers lowered their weeks of supply on hand,"" which would create a headwind to Q3 2025 growth. The Company also announced it was expanding promotions to boost sales and ""offset [] third quarter reductions in retailer trade inventory levels.""

Then, on August 4, 2025, after market hours, BellRing announced disappointing quarterly consumption of Premier Protein RTD Shakes, which had been expected to outpace shipments by a wider margin given previously announced retailer destocking, but instead came ""more in line"" with shipments. On this news, the price of BellRing Brands stock fell $17.46 per share, or nearly 33%, from $53.64 per share on August 4, 2025, to $36.18 per share on August 5, 2025.

"MOH SECURITIES NEWS: Molina Healthcare, Inc. Faces Securities Fraud Allegations after Stock Drops 16% -- Contact BFA Law by December 2 Class Action Deadline","NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) and certain of the Company's senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in Molina, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/molina-healthcare-inc-class-action.

Investors have until December 2, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Molina securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and is captioned: Hindlemann v. Molina Healthcare, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-9461.

Why Was Molina Sued Under the Federal Securities Laws?

Molina is a health insurance company that provides managed healthcare services to low-income individuals under Medicaid and Medicare programs. During the relevant period, Molina stated that the Company's ""earnings growth profile"" was ""solid heading into 2025."" The Company also told investors that it ""continuously monitor[ed] utilization patterns"" and that it was able to ""mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation."" In truth, as alleged, Molina faced increased medical costs pressures that it could not mitigate due to increased utilization in all three of its business lines.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On July 7, 2025, Molina revealed that its Q2 2025 adjusted earnings were approximately $5.50 per share, which was ""below its prior expectations"" due to ""medical cost pressures in all three lines of business."" The Company announced it ""expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year"" and cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share by 10.2% at the midpoint to a ""range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share.""

Then, on July 23, 2025, Molina revealed that it ""now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be no less than $19.00 per diluted share."" Molina stated this was due to a ""challenging medical cost trend environment,"" including increased ""utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services."" On this news, the price of Molina stock fell $32.03 per share, or 16.8%, from $190.25 per share on July 23, 2025, to $158.22 per share on July 24, 2025.

Robotics and AI Drive a New Era of Growth and Uplisting Activity,"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide, from manufacturing and logistics to hospitality and food service. As these sectors expand, small-cap companies are increasingly using acquisitions to scale operations, generate measurable revenue and strengthen their technological capabilities. This strategic growth not only positions these companies to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market but also sets the stage for uplisting from over-the-counter (OTC) markets to national exchanges. Uplisting offers broader visibility, institutional investment opportunities and the resources necessary to accelerate the deployment of AI and robotics innovations. Nightfood Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: NGTF) (Profile), doing business as TechForce Robotics, exemplifies this approach. By completing targeted acquisitions, the company has built a platform that integrates revenue-generating assets with AI-enabled robotics technology. Nightfood Holdings now reports more than $10 million in annualized revenue and a combined acquisition value estimated at approximately $100 million, positioning it to move from expansion to execution as an exchange-ready entity. Nightfood is focused on becoming a significant player in the robotics and AI space, joining other key leaders, such as including NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ: RR) and iRobot Corp. (NASDAQ: IRBT).

Uplisting provides emerging companies with broader visibility and access to a deeper investor base. For small-cap technology firms, including those in robotics and AI, transitioning to a national exchange such as NASDAQ or NYSE American enhances credibility and can facilitate access to capital markets. Uplisting also requires more rigorous reporting standards, which can increase investor confidence in both financials and governance practices.

Data demonstrates that companies undergoing uplisting often experience growth in both trading volume and institutional interest. For robotics and AI firms, this is particularly significant, as these sectors demand long-term investment to fund research, development and deployment of advanced automation solutions. Enhanced market credibility can directly support strategic partnerships and business development initiatives.

Industry forecasts reinforce the importance of scale in AI and robotics. Grand View Research reports that the global service robotics market was valued at approximately $47 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $107 billion by 2030, growing at a 12.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) Companies that achieve uplisting readiness are better positioned to capture market share in this rapidly expanding environment. ""The service robotics has witnessed growing penetration in various sectors owing to factors including precise services, low-cost solutions, flexibility and reduction of human efforts,"" Grandview noted.

For small-cap firms in this growing sector, achieving a national exchange listing signals operational maturity and can attract institutional investors seeking exposure to emerging AI-enabled technologies. Uplisting can also improve liquidity for shareholders, enhance company valuation and provide the foundation for continued acquisitions and strategic growth initiatives.

Nightfood Reaches Uplisting Readiness

Nightfood Holdings reports that its completion of targeted acquisitions has enabled the company to meet key criteria for uplisting. By consolidating strategic assets, the company has built a foundation for operational scale, institutional visibility and regulatory compliance consistent with national exchange requirements.

Recent acquisitions have expanded Nightfood's capabilities in AI-powered hospitality and automation. Most recently, the company announced the successful closing of its fifth acquisition in under two years with the completion of its share exchange transaction to acquire Treasure Mountain Holdings LLC, the owner and operator of the 120-room Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Mirage, California. The transaction was valued at approximately $52.8 million.

Last month the company officially closed on the acquisition of Victorville Treasure Holdings, LLC, the owner of a 155-room Holiday Inn property in Victorville, California. The $31 million share exchange agreement (SEA) represented Nightfood's first completed hotel acquisition. Together, the Rancho Mirage and Victorville acquisitions form the foundation of Nightfood's AI-driven hospitality platform, positioning the company at the forefront of automation in hotel operations.

The hotel acquisitions followed two acquisition announcements made earlier this year: Carryout Supplies, a custom packaging provider that enhances vertical integration across its service ecosystem valued at $10 million, and Skytech Automated Solutions, a $6-million-plus acquisition that bolsters the company's leadership in hotel automation systems. These moves consolidate the company's operational footprint, creating a more integrated platform for deploying AI and robotics technologies. Nightfood now operates across multiple revenue streams while building a foundation for scalability, a critical factor for national exchange eligibility.

The company's acquisition strategy also aligns with investor expectations for small-cap technology firms seeking uplisting. With recurring revenue streams in place from its hotel properties and the high-margin potential of its AI-driven robotics initiatives, Nightfood is strategically aligned to meet uplisting requirements and the company is preparing for its planned uplisting to a national exchange.

Annual Revenue Exceeds $10 Million

Nightfood Holdings now generates more than $10 million in annualized revenue, driven by a diversified portfolio of assets including operating hotels and its packaging subsidiary. The company noted that reaching this $10-million milestone marks its evolution into a high-growth, revenue-generating enterprise built on the integration of recently closed hotel acquisitions and its expanding Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform.

""Reaching the $10 million annualized revenue mark represents a defining milestone and validates our integrated growth model,"" said Nightfood CEO Jimmy Chan. ""Our hotel acquisitions and RaaS platform are working in tandem to deliver measurable results and create long-term shareholder value. We remain focused on executing our roadmap and scaling our presence in the rapidly evolving hospitality automation market.""

The two hotel acquisitions serve as a cornerstone in Nightfood Holdings' evolution into a next-generation technology and asset company. These properties ""create a growing network of AI-connected, real-world deployment environments where [Nightfood's] service robots are being tested, refined, and commercialized,"" the company noted, with each location strengthening both sides of the company's model.

On the balance sheet, these asset-backed real estate holdings enhance book value, stability and collateral strength, while operationally, every hotel serves as a live testbed and proof-of-concept site for the company's RaaS technology, integrating AI-driven automation into high-traffic environments such as hospitality, retail, education and healthcare.

""Together, these acquisitions form a vertically integrated platform that blends tangible assets with scalable robotics innovation, positioning [Nightfood] to become a pioneer in the AI-automation sector,"" the company noted. Carryout Supplies adds a complementary revenue stream and vertical integration, enhancing the company's operational resilience and providing cash flow to support further technology deployment.

A Transformative Leap Forward

Nightfood Holdings's recent acquisitions collectively represent approximately $100 million in transaction value. These acquisitions include both hospitality properties and strategic technology companies that reinforce the company's robotics and AI platform. The Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn acquisitions form the foundation of the company's hospitality and AI automation network, while Carryout Supplies and Skytech Automated Solutions strengthen Nightfood's vertical integration and technology capabilities.

""Closing the Skytech acquisition represents a transformative leap forward for Nightfood,"" said Nightfood chair Jamie Steigerwald, announcing the acquisition earlier this year. ""This strengthens our ability to scale automation across the hospitality industry -- addressing key operational pain points such as labor shortages and rising costs. Together with the Carryout Supplies acquisition, we're building a powerful ecosystem designed to lead the future of hotel automation.""

This disciplined merger and acquisition strategy enables Nightfood to scale operations efficiently and demonstrate verified market impact, two factors critical for institutional visibility and investor confidence. It also underscores the company's capacity to execute on complex acquisitions while maintaining operational coherence. By combining this array of assets under one platform, Nightfood Holdings positions itself to capitalize on growth opportunities in both AI-enabled robotics and real-world service environments. The scale of acquisitions also supports future expansion and continued technological integration.

Looking Ahead: Scaling Robotics and AI

The robotics and AI sectors are poised for significant growth, with emerging technologies transforming operational efficiency across multiple industries, including hospitality. Nightfood Holdings represents a clear example of how small-cap companies can leverage strategic acquisitions to achieve scale, revenue visibility, and exchange-readiness.

With reported acquisition values exceeding $100 million and annualized revenue surpassing $10 million, Nightfood Holdings has positioned itself as a technology-driven platform capable of deploying AI solutions at scale. Its portfolio, spanning hospitality, packaging and automation technology, provides both cash-flow stability and real-world testing opportunities.

Looking forward, Nightfood Holdings intends to continue integrating its assets, expanding automation deployment across hospitality operations and executing on initiatives that support its uplisting objectives. The company's trajectory reflects the broader trend of AI and robotics firms combining technological innovation with tangible operational assets to enhance market positioning.

As AI-enabled robotics continues to reshape industries globally, Nightfood Holdings exemplifies how small-cap companies can achieve credibility, scale and visibility, key ingredients for sustained growth and exchange-ready readiness.

"KMX SECURITIES NEWS: CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) Faces a Securities Fraud Investigation after Stock Drops 20% -- Contact BFA Law if You Suffered Losses","NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces an investigation into CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) for potential violations of the federal securities laws.

If you invested in CarMax, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/carmax-inc-class-action.

Why Is CarMax being Investigated?

CarMax sells used cars. During the relevant period, the Company touted the strong and sustainable demand for its cars, driven by factors such as a seamless customer experience. CarMax also stated that it had properly assessed and reserved for the risk of the car loans it previously issued to customers.

In truth, it appears that the announcement of U.S. tariffs imposed on cars provided a short-term boost to demand, as customers purchased cars prior to the tariffs taking effect, and CarMax had not properly assessed or reserved for its portfolio of car loans.

The Stock Declines as the Truth Is Revealed

On September 25, 2025, the Company reported disappointing financial results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Specifically, CarMax announced sales declines across the board, including a 5.4% decline in retail used unit sales, a 6.3% decline in comparable store used unit sales, and a 2.2% decline in wholesale units. The Company also posted a disappointing Q2 net earnings of about $95.4 million, down from $132.8 million over the prior year. A main reason for the declines, according to CarMax, was a ""pull forward"" in demand into Q1 due to the announcement of tariffs. CarMax further reported an 11.2% decrease in income from its financing segment year-over-year, which it attributed to a loan loss provision for the quarter of $142.2 million.

On this news, the price of CarMax stock fell $11.45 per share, or roughly 20%, from $57.05 per share on September 24, 2025, to $45.60 per share on September 25, 2025.

All three benchmark indices logged weekly gains, with the S&P 500 advancing 0.63%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.45% and the Dow Jones rising by 0.52%.

Insights From Analysts

As markets head into the trading day, analysts are highlighting robust corporate performance while also flagging growing pressures on the American consumer.

Charlie Bilello, Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning, pointed to the strength of the current earnings season as the key driver for record-high markets.

With 10% of companies having reported, Bilello notes, ""S&P 500 operating earnings are expected to hit another record high (TTM), up 10% over the last year."" He emphasized that the underlying fundamentals remain ""very positive"" and that the main driver for the market is ""earnings, earnings, earnings.""

Conversely, Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, shed light on a significant headwind from tariffs. Citing Goldman Sachs research, Detrick warned that the cost burden is shifting away from businesses and onto shoppers.

While ""consumers are paying 37% of the tariffs"" currently, he noted, ""it'll eventually be 55%."" This analysis suggests that as US businesses reduce their share of the cost from 51% down to 22%, the resulting squeeze on consumers could challenge future spending and corporate profitability.

"Cathie Wood Says Elon Musk's New Tesla Pay Package Will 'Win Decisively' Despite Opposition: 'Sad, If Not Damning...' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)","ARK Invests' CEO Cathie Wood believes that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package will be approved during the shareholder meeting next month.

Check out the current price of TSLA here.

A Decisive Victory

On Sunday, the investor took to the social media platform X to share her thoughts on the International Shareholder Services (ISS) opposition to Musk's pay package. ""When shareholders first voted on @elonmusk's 2018 pay package, #Tesla was not in any index, and the pay package won decisively,"" Wood said. She added that Tesla was at 1.2% of the S&P 500 when the second pay package vote was ""forced by an activist Delaware judge.""

Tesla currently stands at 2.4% of the S&P 500, which Wood said was ""not enough for index funds to swing the vote."" She added that ""Elon's [Musk] new package will win decisively.""

In another post, she had criticized the ISS's recommendation to vote against the pay package. ""Isn't it sad, if not damning, that institutional shareholders rely on proxy firms to tell them how they should vote? Index funds do no fundamental research, yet dominate institutional voting,"" She said, calling index-based investing a ""form of socialism.""

Elon Musk Hits Back, Dan Ives Says Pay Package Will Be A Major Focus

The news comes as Musk recently hit back at critics who expressed doubts about the new pay package, saying that Tesla was worth more than all of its competitors combined and currently has a $1.4 trillion market capitalization.

Meanwhile, Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities' investor, Dan Ives, said that Musk's new pay package, which would be a major focus in next month's shareholder meeting, would be approved alongside an investment in Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.

"Tesla Investor Ross Gerber Says 'Super Sad' To See Federal EV Subsidies End: 'Credits Created...' - Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM)","Investment Firm Gerber Kawasaki's co-founder Ross Gerber has lamented the end of the Federal EV Credit, which ceased after the September 30 deadline outlined by President Donald Trump.

EV Credits Work, Says Ross Gerber

""The end of the credits created an EV boom in California,"" Gerber said in a post on the social media platform X on Sunday. He added that EVs made up almost 30% of total vehicle sales in California. ""These credits work and super sad to see them go..."" Gerber said.

It's worth noting that Gerber is an investor in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and once held bullish views on the company and its progress in the sector, but has since become a vocal critic of the EV giant and its CEO, Elon Musk. Earlier this year, Gerber had confirmed that his firm was lowering its stake in Tesla, but hasn't completely exited its position due to undisclosed reasons.

Norway's Incentive Rollback

The news comes as Norway joined the U.S. in rolling back on incentives offered on electric vehicles. The country announced a revised proposal to offer incentives on EVs priced under 300,000 Kroner (roughly $29,700) instead of the previous 500,000 Kroner (approximately $49,500) threshold.

The country is also a key market for Tesla, with the region defying the EV giant's European sales slump, with Tesla recording a 24% surge in the first seven months of 2025.

Texas Offers EV Incentives, Ford And GM Rescind Discounts

Meanwhile, Texas is offering incentives on EVs and alternative fuel vehicles in the state, with customers standing to benefit from up to $2,500 worth of incentives on EVs and up to $5,000 on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) vehicles.

However, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) are both rescinding the proposed extensions to the Federal EV credit after the deadline. The automakers would reportedly have made down payments for units to dealers via the companies' financial arms to qualify the units for the EV credit. Other companies like Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), however, are still offering EV incentives.

Robotaxi, Optimus And Cybercab Remain Major Focus, Says Dan Ives

The investor shared his thoughts in a post on the social media platform X on Sunday. ""A major focus on Tesla's call will be the Robotaxi rollout across the US and volume production trajectory for Cybercabs/Optimus in 2026,"" Ives said in the post.

He also expressed confidence about Musk's pay package receiving shareholder approval. ""We expect Musk pay package and xAI stake to be approved,"" Ives said.

Merger Talks, Optimus Push

A merger of Tesla and Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, or an investment into the company by the automaker, has been endorsed in the past by experts like Social Capital's founder Chamath Palihapitiya, as well as Deepwater Asset Management's investor Gene Munster.

Tesla has been pushing towards artificial intelligence and Robotics, as highlighted in the company's Master Plan IV, which laid down Tesla's roadmap for the coming years. Coinciding with the AI push, Musk predicted that the Optimus humanoid robot would account for over 80% of Tesla's future value.

Cybercab Spotted Testing

In a video shared by influencer Sawyer Merritt on Sunday, we see the Tesla Cybercab up close in action for the first time since it was unveiled in October last year and spotted on multiple occasions. The Cybercab(s) can be seen driving autonomously, with one of the units halting at a stop sign at the automaker's Giga factory in Texas. The Cybercab also had the ""Tesla Engineering Prototype V_001"" written on the door panel.

Gary Black's Earnings Call Prediction, Ross Gerber On Cybercab's Alternate Use

Future Fund LLC's managing director, Gary Black, predicted that Musk wouldn't answer questions regarding the removal of onboard safety operators from Tesla's Robotaxis during the upcoming earnings call. Tesla currently provides Robotaxis in Austin as well as a ride-hailing service in California.

The company also recently moved onboard safety operators in Austin to the driver's seat from the passenger seat, in a move likely to be the automaker's response to updated self-driving regulations in Texas.

Meanwhile, investment firm Gerber Kawasaki's co-founder Ross Gerber suggested that Tesla should put a steering wheel in the Cybercab and sell it as a two-door, affordable Tesla model instead of the standard, trimmed-down variants of the Model Y and Model 3 as the affordable options in the lineup.

Tesla scores well on Momentum, Quality and Growth metrics, but offers poor Value. Tesla also offers a favorable price trend in the Short, Medium and Long term. For more such insights, sign up for Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings today!

"Asia stocks rise: Japan surges on political clarity, China buoyed by positive GDP By Investing.com","Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks advanced on Monday, with Japanese shares hitting record highs amid renewed bets that fiscal dove Sanae Takaichi will secure the premiership, while Chinese markets took support from mildly positive economic growth data.

Regional markets took a positive lead-in from Wall Street after U.S. officials struck a conciliatory tone on brewing trade conflict with China. High-level Sino-U.S. trade talks are also set to continue in the coming weeks.

S&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% in Asian trade, with focus on a slew of major third-quarter earnings in the coming days. Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will report on Tuesday, while electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is due on Wednesday.

Japan's Nikkei at record highs on Takaichi premiership cheer

Japan's Nikkei 225 surged nearly 3% to a record high of 48,975.0 points, while the TOPIX jumped 1.9% to 3,231.35 points, remaining close to a recent peak.

A host of local media reports said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party had secured enough backing from its allies to form a coalition government with Takaichi as prime minister.

Takaichi is viewed as a fiscal dove, and is broadly expected to increase government spending and oppose more interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan. Her election as the leader of the LDP in late-September had sparked a stellar rally in Japanese markets, on bets of more accommodative conditions under her premiership.

A parliamentary vote on Takaichi's premiership is expected to take place on Tuesday, with the LDP leader set to become Japan's first female prime minister.

China rises on positive GDP, Hong Kong rallies on tech rebound

China's Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes rose 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, extending early gains on stronger-than-expected third quarter gross domestic product data.

GDP grew 4.8% year-on-year in Q3, slightly above forecasts of 4.7%. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth also beat expectations, while year-to-date GDP growth remained above Beijing's 5% annual target.

The print showed sustained strength in China's key export industries, which so far helped offset sustained weakness in consumer spending and the property market.

But Chinese exports now face increased U.S. headwinds, amid renewed trade tensions between the world's largest economies. Persistent deflation and weak private investment also present headwinds for the world's second-largest economy.

Still, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that he viewed a trade war with China as ""unsustainable,"" and that high-level talks with Beijing were set to take place in the coming weeks.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was a standout performer, rallying 2.5% from a 1-½ month low hit on Friday. Tech stocks led this rebound, after bearing the brunt of selling last week.

Broader Asian markets were mostly positive. South Korea's KOSPI rose 1.2% and came close to a record high, also benefiting from sustained strength in tech shares, especially chipmakers.

Memory chip giant SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) jumped over 3% to a record high, extending recent gains following positive earnings from chipmaking bellwether TSMC.

TSMC (TW:2330) rose 2% in Taipei trade and remained close to record highs, after it clocked stellar third-quarter earnings last week.

Futures for India's Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, while Australia's ASX 200 added 0.1%.

"Elon Musk Claps Back At Hefty Pay Critics: 'Which Of Those CEOs Would You Like To Run Tesla?'  --  Company Worth More Than All Other Automakers Combined - BYD (OTC:BYDDF), BYD (OTC:BYDDY)","Elon Musk has defended his position as the Tesla Inc.

'Tesla Worth More Than Competition' Says Elon Musk

On Saturday, Romain Hedouin, a user on the social media platform X, criticized Musk's multi-billion-dollar payout for reaching a part of the milestones laid out in the new pay package.

Hedouin, a self-proclaimed Tesla ""fan,"" said that Musk would be paid over $20 billion for taking the EV giant to a 2 trillion market capitalization within the next decade, a 3.8% annual growth, according to him.

""That would barely beat inflation, and it would underperform the S&P 500 considerably,"" Hedouin said, adding that the new pay package would be ""over-pay for its CEO.""

Responding to the post, Musk defended his position as the CEO of the company on Sunday.

""Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,"" he said in his response, questioning which of the other CEOs Hedouin would like to see take Musk's position and ""run"" Tesla. ""It won't be me,"" Musk added.

It's worth noting that Tesla's current market capitalization is over $1.4 trillion and the EV giant is the largest automaker in the world by market capitalization today.

For context, it is worth more than the combined market cap of the three largest automakers in the world after Tesla, which are Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM), Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) and BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF). The combined market cap for the trio is roughly $541 billion currently, less than half of Tesla's total.

NHTSA's FSD Scrutiny, Tesla's Appeal To Delaware Supreme Court

The comments come as Tesla has been under the scrutiny of the NHTSA, which announced a probe into the automaker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology after it received multiple reports of violations committed by the FSD system.

However, some experts, like Deepwater Asset Management investor Gene Munster, believe the agency's probe into Tesla could actually be good for the company as it showcases Tesla's efforts to develop the technology.

Meanwhile, Tesla urged the Delaware Supreme Court to restore Musk's previous $56 billion pay package, which was struck down by a judge last year. Lawyers representing the company reiterated that the shareholder vote ratifying Musk's pay package was ""the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history.""

Sacks told Benioff about Elon Musk's working style, ""He still works incredibly hard. I visited him recently as well and I think I left around midnight and he was still going. I think he must have gone until 2 a.m. or something.""

""I don't know anybody who works as hard as him,"" said Sacks.""

Maye Musk's tweet offers a glimpse into Elon's intense work schedule, which often extends late into the night. This dedication aligns with Elon's well-documented commitment to his work, as he frequently discusses his long hours and the importance of hard work in achieving success.

Elon Musk Emphasizes Working 'Super Hard'

Elon Musk's work ethic has been a topic of discussion for years. In a 2014 commencement speech, he emphasized the importance of working ""super hard,"" sharing anecdotes from his early career. His approach is simple: working more hours than others leads to greater accomplishments. This philosophy has been a driving force behind his success with companies like Tesla and SpaceX. A recent Benzinga article highlighted Elon's belief that working 100 hours a week allows him to achieve twice as much as those working 50 hours.

Not Only Musk, Even Jensen Huang Is 'Hardcore'

The Tesla CEO's dedication to work often blurs the lines between his professional and personal life. In an interview with BBC North America's tech reporter, he mentioned being ""swarmed by men"" at parties who want to discuss projects, making it difficult to trust people. This relentless work ethic is not unique to Elon; it echoes sentiments shared by other tech leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who described his own intense work routine as ""hardcore.""

"US stock futures steady with China trade talks, Q3 earnings in focus By Investing.com","Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly on Sunday evening, taking some relief from White House officials stating that more trade talks with China will take place in the coming days to stem a potential escalation in their trade war.

Focus was squarely on a host of upcoming third-quarter earnings this week, with Tesla and Netflix set to report in the coming days.

S&P 500 Futures rose slightly to 6,704.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 25,0307.25 points by 19:53 ET (23:53 GMT). Dow Jones Futureswere flat at 46,385.0 points.

Futures rose after a positive Friday session on Wall Street, as markets were encouraged by President Donald Trump stating that higher trade tariffs against China were unsustainable. His comments spurred hopes for a deescalation in trade tensions between the world's largest economies.

But uncertainty over a potential credit crunch in regional U.S. banks limited overall gains in Wall Street, which faced increased volatility at record highs in recent weeks.

Wall St cheered by hopes of US-China trade deescalation

Wall Street indexes closed higher on Friday after Trump said that a prolonged tariff exchange with China was likely to be unsustainable. Trump also confirmed he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks.

Separately, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects to meet with Chinese officials in Malaysia this week to dial down a recent escalation in trade tensions.

Heightened U.S.-China tensions had battered Wall Street earlier in October, with stock benchmarks falling from record highs after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs against China, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.

But Wall Street found some relief as Trump tempered his rhetoric. The US500 rose 0.5% to 6,664.01 points, while the IXIC rose 0.5% to 22,679.98 points on Friday. The DJI rose 0.5% to 46,190.61 points.

Wall Street also logged mild weekly gains, although these were limited by growing concerns over the credit health of regional U.S. banks.

Tesla, Netflix to headline Q3 earnings this week

A host of Wall Street majors are set to report their third-quarter earnings this week, with streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) due on Tuesday, while electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report on Wednesday.

Others, including GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM), Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), will report earnings in the coming days.

Focus will be squarely on whether corporate profits persevered amid some disruptions from trade tariffs and a cooling labor market. Markets are seeking more cues on the U.S. economy after an ongoing government shutdown delayed the release of several key economic readings.

"Move Over, Musk -- The World's Richest Woman Joined the $100B Club - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT)","Alice Walton and Elon Musk represent two titans of wealth from very different sectors, with 2025 marking a groundbreaking year for each.

Walton, the world's richest woman, has joined the elite centibillionaire club with a net worth of $106 billion, propelled by gains in Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares.

Musk made history as the first person to reach a $500 billion net worth in 2025, his holdings riding on the explosive ascent of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and his other ventures.

TSLA stock is moving. See the details here.

Alice Walton - World's Richest Woman

Alice Walton is intrinsically linked to Walmart, inheriting her fortune as the daughter of founder Sam Walton.

Despite periodic reductions in her direct holdings, she remains a major shareholder, with the Walton family controlling about 48% of Walmart's outstanding shares as of May 2025.

Her wealth is tightly correlated with Walmart's stock performance. Walmart's stock experienced remarkable gains in 2025, posting a 19.24% year-to-date return through Oct.17, building on a strong 70% increase in 2024.

The increase in Walmart's share price has pushed Walton's personal fortune over the $100 billion mark to around $106 billion, according to Forbes.

Elon Musk - World's Richest Man

Musk's net worth is built on his outsized ownership of Tesla, with approximately 75% of his wealth sourced from TSLA stock and complemented by sizable stakes in SpaceX and other companies.

Tesla shares are up 82% over the past six months, but following a rocky start to 2025, the stock is only up 8% year-to-date. Musk continues to be the largest individual shareholder in Tesla.

According to Forbes, Musk passed the $500 billion mark in October, positioning him as the world's richest man and half-way to becoming the first-ever trillionaire.

The Takeaway

While both Walton and Musk benefit from large stock positions, Musk's record-breaking $500 billion fortune is nearly fivefold Walton's $106 billion.

The comparison highlights not only the sheer scale of contemporary wealth, but also the contrasting paths -- one rooted in legacy retail, the other in disruptive tech -- by which the richest individuals capitalize on stock market booms to redefine global wealth leadership.

"Nearly 10,000 People Jumped Into ""Super AI"" Last Week: Here's How You Can Too","Editor's Note: Last week's Super AI Trading Event broke every record in TradeSmith's 20-year history - and for good reason.

Nearly 10,000 investors tuned in to see how a simple five-stock portfolio, guided entirely by artificial intelligence, could have delivered 374% average annual gains over the past five years.

If you missed the event, you can still catch the replay while it's still available.

Today, TradeSmith CEO Keith Kaplan is joining us to share how this breakthrough could finally level the playing field between Main Street and Wall Street.

If you're one of the 9,225 curious individuals who helped make last week Super AI Trading Event a success, thank you!

By showing up and seeing what it was all about, you helped make it the most successful launch in TradeSmith's 20-year history.

At one point, we had 119 callers in a queue waiting to speak with our customer service team. I'm told it was the biggest call volume we've ever seen after an event. All told, our agents were on the phones for 10 hours with folks looking to learn more.

And although I'm thrilled by the level of interest, I'm not entirely surprised. Last week's event was a historic moment for everyday investors.

We showed how a simple five-stock portfolio strategy - guided entirely by an AI algorithm - could have produced an average annual return of 374% over the past five years.

That's more than 22 times the average annual return of the S&P 500 over the same time.

And it didn't just perform well in bull markets. That five-year span includes the pandemic, the market's tariff tantrum in April, swings in interest rates, and two wars.

Even more impressive, following this portfolio doesn't require leverage, options trading, or sitting in front of a screen all day. If you can follow simple alerts, you're all set. You can get up can running in minutes.

So again, a BIG thank you to folks who made it to the event last week.

For too long, Wall Street firms like Citadel, Renaissance Technologies, and Two Sigma have used powerful software to stack the odds in their favor. Thousands of other hedge funds do the same.

It's a secret weapon - and it works. Citadel took home $16 billion in profits in 2022, mainly from software-based trading. That's the biggest one-year haul for any hedge fund in history.

That's great for mega-rich folks on Wall Street. But I never worked on Wall Street. And I've always believed it's wrong that these powerful software tools remain locked up inside hedge funds - widening the wealth gap instead of narrowing it.

That's why I'm so happy thousands of people checked out our new AI breakthrough. Putting this technology in the hands of regular investors blows that cozy Wall Street cartel wide open.

You can still catch the event before my publisher takes it offline. So, make sure to watch the replay here. Today, I'll give you a quick recap... and show you what comes next.

TradeSmith a leading financial technology platform based in Baltimore, Maryland.

We're part of the Nasdaq-listed investment research company MarketWise -- alongside Stansberry Research, Chaikin Analytics, InvestorPlace, Brownstone Research, Wide Moat Research, and Altimetry.

As TradeSmith's CEO, I manage a team of 74 researchers and developers and an $8 million annual budget to create world-class software tools and analytics.

We've built tools to help investors track portfolios, manage risk, spot seasonality patterns in stocks, and generate regular income in the options market.

Even before ChatGPT burst onto the scene in November 2022, we were focused on harnessing AI to give our customers a sharper edge.

In 2023, we launched our first AI-powered trading model, Predictive Alpha.

It projects prices - up to 21 trading days in advance - for 2,334 stocks every day.

For some stocks, the price hits our projection more than 90% of the time.

And we consistently see accuracy above 70%.

And when we've traded single-stock projections using this system, the results have been remarkable.

On July 27, 2023, our model predicted that Opendoor Technologies Inc. (OPEN) would soon hit a price of $4.87.

The stock hit that price just 24 hours later. And my team booked a 9.4% gain on that pick.

That's like growing your money 34 times in a year.

And you could have boosted that gain to 244% in just 24 hours with a special kind of trade.

Or take restaurant chain Wingstop Inc. (WING). On June 4, our AI projected a 74% probability of the stock rising over the next 21 days to $384.87.

Wingstop reached that price within 24 hours of our recommendation - delivering a 3.6% gain in a single day, which you could have boosted to 156% in the same time span.

Then, this past May, our model predicted Tesla Inc. (TSLA) would hit $302.89 within 21 trading days.

It reached that price even faster than expected. We booked a 5.2% gain in 24 hours, which could have been boosted to 310% using the same kind of trade.

But my team and I wanted to make this technology even more accessible - and even more powerful. So we created a breakthrough we call The AI Super Portfolio.

It holds just five stock positions at any time.

The technical details are too much to cover here. But incredibly simple to follow. You hold the five top positions based on our AI's projections. Then you rotate into a new set of five when the AI says it's time to sell.

As I mentioned earlier, this strategy could have produced an average annual gain of 374% in a recent five-year study.

And last year alone, it could have delivered a 602% backtested gain.

No guesswork. No chasing headlines. Just a repeatable process grounded in data, discipline, and extensive testing.

It's the clearest proof yet that AI isn't just changing investing - it's redefining what's possible for individual investors.

And you can still be a part of this excited new breakthrough.

If you missed last week's event, you can still catch the replay.

I hope you'll check it out. You'll see how this technology is helping Main Street investors claim the same advantages hedge funds have enjoyed for decades.

I also get into more detail on how the system works... the results it's produced in our testing... and why I believe systems like these will soon put financial advisors out of work.

We sent out the first live five-stock recommendations from our ""Super AI"" a few days ago.

But it's not too late to join or act on these trades - plus, trades rotate regularly, so if you miss out on one trade, you'll have a brand-new one to replace it soon.",2025-10-19
A stock trader's guide to navigating China's curb on rare earths,"The names -- holmium, europium, ytterbium, thulium, erbium -- don't show up in any of the investing classics. But they're fast becoming an integral part of the Wall Street lexicon.

These minerals, and others in the category known as rare earths, are used to make advanced weaponry, cutting-edge computer chips and high-tech cars. And China, which controls some 70% of the mining and near 90% of processing, is curbing access to them.

The implications for investors are far-reaching, as countries led by the US scramble to shore up access to the raw materials, often by funneling investments to miners outside of China. End users, from ASML Holding NV to Ford Motor Co. to Hyundai Motor Co., likely will have to ensure supplies or pivot to technologies that don't require them. The stakes are high, since lacking even a single input can snarl entire production lines.

Investors looking for clues on how to trade the new era got a small lesson in April, when Beijing slapped curbs on seven rare earths, gumming up some carmakers' productions. Now, the broader restrictions stand to impact a bigger slice of the market, if they take effect in December.

""By increasing the number of rare earths subject to export controls, it's likely to make the issue relevant to a greater number of sectors,"" said Katherine Ogundiya, a thematic investing analyst at Barclays.

The issue is not just more metals will face curbs; the number of products subject to restrictions is also surging. That prompted a rush to shares of rare earth miners and processors, many of which have seen triple-digit gains this year.

Market reactions for rare earth users have been more muted so far, with traders speculating that China is using the new curbs as a bargaining chip. President Donald Trump tamped down his own rhetoric on Friday. But with tensions between the two superpowers showing few signs of easing, prudent traders have begun assessing just what might happen if the restrictions come into force.

Here are some sectors and stocks to watch:

Miners

Companies outside of China that can extract these scarce materials from the earth have already seen incredible share-price gains. In Australia, shares of Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., a major supplier backed by billionaire Gina Rinehart, almost tripled this year.

MP Materials Corp. soared over 150% since the US government took a stake that will help it expand production capacity. Shares of Critical Metals Corp., a Canadian miner that's developing deposits in Greenland, rallied on a report suggesting the US was considering an equity position, which the Trump administration later denied.

Geopolitical tensions and deal speculations create a ""security premium"" for the sector, said B. Riley Securities analyst Ryan Pfingst.

Investors have to weigh whether gains can be sustained, and place bets on if Western nations will invest more in domestic champions. MP Materials remains loss-making. Lynas broke even in its most recent fiscal year, and analysts said it will take years for output to catch up with Chinese peers.

China's miners have naturally benefited. Expectations for higher metals prices powered gains in shares of state-owned miners including China Rare Earth Resources and Technology Co. and China Northern Rare Earth High-Tech Co.

Semiconductors

The artificial intelligence boom has already made chipmakers the most important players in global stock indexes. Rare earths are critical to their production. A polishing liquid that contains cerium is used in a process to make wafers. Coatings made of Yttrium shield equipment components from corrosion. Lanthanum is added to many optical systems.

And China controls nearly the entire supply of them all, creating a potential choke point for chip equipment suppliers, according to Bank of America Corp. analysts including Didier Scemama.

While rare earths account for just a small portion of overall production costs for the chip industry, ""to have that stop you is incredibly damaging,"" said Willis Thomas, Principal Consultant at CRU Group.

That means companies like Applied Materials Inc., Tokyo Electron Ltd., ASM International NV and Lam Research Corp. could be at risk.

So far, investors haven't grown skittish. BofA says current levels of strategic inventories should be sufficient for the next 12 to 18 months. The chip sector is trading near an all-time high following strong results at ASML and its top client, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ASML said it's ""well prepared"" for the curbs, and has materials for the ""next couple of months.""

Defense

Weapons and drones can't be made without rare earth elements. An F-35 fighter jet, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., carries about 900 pounds of rare earth materials. A Virginia-classed nuclear submarine, built by General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., requires about 9,200 pounds. One drone motor contains between 12 and 60 magnets made from rare earth metals.

The question is whether these manufacturers can continue to access the minerals critical to production if the restrictions essentially block any rare earth exports to overseas military users.

""Even a few hundred thousand euros' worth of parts can halt production given they often have only one supplier,"" said Jens-Peter Rieck, an analyst at mwb research AG.

Investors will have to determine whether contractors get enough government support to justify already rising valuations. Rheinmetall AG jumped over 170% this year after Germany expanded its military budget. Lockheed erased yearly declines following speculation the US government might take a stake.

Automakers

A wide range of car components used in gas-powered and electric vehicles rely on rare earths. They are vital to parts like traction motors, sensors and braking systems, even though just a few hundred grams are needed in some cases.

China's restrictions in April brought disruptions, with Ford temporarily shuttering a factory in Chicago in May because it ran short of rare earth components. That put investors in the likes of Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG on alert for strategies that mitigate reliance on China.

BMW AG's generation 5 and 6 and Renault SA's E-Tech electric vehicle models are using motor technology that doesn't require rare earth magnets, according to Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin. Indian automakers are also testing ferrite-based magnets, Bloomberg reported. Tesla Inc. laid out a plan to remove rare earths from its future models in 2023. Its Optimus robots would still need to use these elements.

Another strategy is to secure metals from suppliers outside of China. General Motors Co. has signed three domestic supply contracts for rare earth magnets, including a deal with Texas-based Noveon Magnetics Inc. in August.

Renewables

Like carmakers, wind turbine makers are diversifying their supply chain away from China, giving investors a metric to home in on. Siemens Energy AG signed an agreement in June to procure magnets from Japan's TDK Corp. Australia's Arafura Rare Earths Ltd. supplies both Siemens Energy and GE Vernova Inc.

Neodymium and dysprosium are two key elements for the wind power industry, and even without trade restrictions, analysts warn that the supply is at risk of being outstripped. About 10% of permanent magnets were used for wind turbines, according to a 2022 paper by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

While China's new restrictions could push up metals prices, the industry has adapted well in the past, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alessio Mastrandrea. He sees limited cost pressures on companies like Vestas Wind Systems A/S and expects any to be passed on to customers, if needed.

"'There Are Plenty of Risks, And Yet...' Says Top Investor About Tesla Stock","Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will command plenty of attention this week, as its upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report on Wednesday is among the market's most eagerly anticipated quarterly prints. Tesla has been on a nice run of late, a welcome reprieve after a rough start to the year.

Q3 deliveries of 497,099 set a new company record, breaking a series of quarters with declining year-over-year numbers. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk seemingly has both hands on the steering wheel, with a potential compensation package of some $1 trillion providing no shortage of motivation.

The company's share price has gained more than 90% over the past six months, recovering from a dip during the initial part of the year. Q3 estimates of $26.58 billion in revenues and a normalized EPS of $0.55 would represent sequential gains, begging the question of whether TSLA's recent momentum will continue.

Though acknowledging some of the risks, including EV competition, AI monetization, and the wildcard of Musk's political dalliances, top investor Victor Dergunov is going all in.

""Tesla, Inc. is upgraded to a Strong Buy, driven by Elon Musk's conviction, record EV deliveries, and transformative growth in AI, FSD, and energy,"" exclaims the 5-star investor, who is among the top 3% of stock pros covered by TipRanks.

It's nearly impossible to discuss TSLA's prospects without mentioning Elon Musk, and the CEO's commitment is one of the reasons for Dergunov's bullish take. The investor notes Musk's potential compensation plan as well as a recent $1 billion worth of stock purchases on the open market as signs that the CEO is fully engaged.

The investor is also pleased by Tesla's recent Q3 deliveries, and points to the company's Model Y refresh as another reason for continued optimism. All told, Dergunov suggests that Tesla's Q3 revenues could have reached $29 billion, and the investor predicts that more gains are looming on the horizon.

""A 12-month price target of $650 and a long-term target of $2,500-3,500 are set for TSLA stock, while acknowledging risks in execution, competition, and valuation,"" sums up Dergunov, who rates TSLA a Strong Buy. (To watch Victor Dergunov's track record, click here)

Wall Street has a mixed view regarding Tesla as this momentous week begins. With 15 Buys, 13 Holds, and 10 Sells, TSLA carries a consensus Hold (i.e. Neutral) rating. Its 12-month average price target of $365.82 implies losses of ~17%. (See TSLA stock forecast)

"China May Have Achieved Solid-State Battery Breakthrough With 600-Mile Range: Here's All You Need To Know - BYD (OTC:BYDDF), BYD (OTC:BYDDY)","China may have just had multiple breakthroughs in EV battery technology with new solid-state battery tech that could offer more than 600 miles of range and weigh at 220 lbs. For reference, batteries typically used in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) models weigh well over 1,200 lbs.

A solid-state battery uses a solid electrolyte instead of a typical liquid-based solution, which can result in a more compact size, tighter packaging, better safety, as well as faster charging.

Chinese Researchers Develop ""Special Glue""

According to a report in China Central Television (CCTV), scientists at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and some other researchers developed ""iodine ions,"" which the report termed as ""special glue"" that, during battery operations, attract lithium ions and pass through gaps, forming a continuous bond between electrolyte and electrode.

Other breakthroughs include a special skeleton made for the electrolyte, termed ""flexible transformation"" by researchers at the Institute of Metal Research and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The skeleton can increase battery capacity by 86%, the report said, adding that it can withstand ""20,000 bends and twists, remaining intact.""

The third breakthrough, called ""Fluoro Reinforcement,"" is an initiative by Tsinghua University, which creates a protective layer of Fluorine around the electrode. The technology ""survived needle penetration tests and 120°C high-temperature chamber tests without exploding,"" the report said.

Toyota, Stellantis Working On Solid State Batteries

Solid-state batteries are the next step in EVs, with numerous companies working on developing the technology. Recently, Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) announced a partnership with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (OTC:SMMYY) to procure cathode materials to aid in developing solid-state batteries.

Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), too, had unveiled plans to utilize Factorial Energy's solid-state batteries in a demonstration fleet in 2026, with the batteries reportedly showcasing a 375 Wh/kg energy density in over 600 charge cycles and the ability to operate in temperatures ranging from -22°F to 113°F.

QuantumScape's VW Demo, MicroVast Develops Solid State Batteries

QuantumScape Corp (NYSE:QS), in partnership with German automaker Volkswagen's PowerCo, conducted a successful demonstration of the company's first solid-state lithium-metal battery, powering an electric motorcycle.

Meanwhile, Microvast Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) is also reportedly developing solid-state batteries, using a unique bipolar stacking design for the battery. The technology, while still in preliminary phases, could prove to be beneficial for the company as EV battery tech evolves further.

China Dominates Global Battery Installations

Chinese companies like Contemporary Amperex Technologies Ltd. (CATL) and BYD Co. Ltd. (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDF) continue to dominate the global battery installations rankings, making up for over 50% of the market share split between the two companies.

Latest data showed that battery installations from January to August clocked in at 691.3 GWh, marking a 34.9% YoY increase with CATL accounting for 254.5GWh worth of installations while BYD, in second place, represented 124.8GWh worth of batteries installed worldwide.
